# Red Imperium

Red Imperium invites two to six players to lead one of eight unique factions in a quest for control over the galaxy. Success relies on military strength, diplomatic cunning, and savvy economic planning. Only one will ultimately triumph and rule a new thousand-year empire from the seat of New Byzantium. 

Each game of Red Imperium unfolds differently. Each faction available for play offers a distinct style of play, with some factions benefiting from bonuses in space combat, while others have slight advantages in trade or the development of critical technologies. The board for every game is also uniquely constructed from tiles that represent everything thriving industrial and commercial worlds to dangerous space anomalies like black holes and impenetrable asteroid belts. As the game advances, factions also vote on new laws and develop new technologies that will change the rules of the game and the scope of what is possible.

Victory is achieved by accumulating points, which are awarded for completing objectives. Public objectives are revealed progressively in each round of the game, while players can also collect secret objectives which provide points-scoring golds for them and only them -- if they can achieve them. Saito supports games of different length. We recommends games with 10-14 Victory Points.

## How to Play

Red Imperium pulls many of its gameplay mechanics from the popular game Twilight Imperium IV. One of the goals of its development is to provide an open source clone of this type of game so that players can customize

The game comes with wholly-refreshed graphics, new strategy and action cards, and the ability and the ability to customize rules and games. The areas where gameplay is different largely revolve around changes made to streamline gameplay for simultaneous, remote play, speeding up the game so that an in-person game that takes up to 8 or 10 hours can be played online in only 3-4 hours.

# Use Cases

## What Does Saito Do?

A common question for those investigating a new blockchain is: what are the use cases? Money, smart contracts, decentralized finance, trustless computation - use cases are evolving constantly. But the creation of new projects to address each use case is unecessary and counter-productive. The common utility beneath all blockchain use cases is the *universal broadcast network*, and the quality of any application of blockchain ultimately relies on this.


Technically, any blockchain with an *open* consensus mechanism can serve as a universal broadcast network. The reason most blockchains specifically focus on a subset of use cases is that access to this basic commodity, blockspace, is not affordable at scale. It is primarily financial use cases for those who can justify paying high fees in search of high returns which materialize.

Saito's consensus mechanism is fundamentally oriented towards providing an application-agnostic universal broadcast layer, which is optimizes for providing [security](https://wiki.saito.io/consensus/majoritarian-attacks) and affordability for any permisionless application at any scale, including applications for which blockchain was previously too expensive to even consider. By optimizing for universal broadcast rather than any specific use case, the network bears utility for users of all financial and social status.

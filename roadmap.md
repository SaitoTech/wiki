# History and Roadmap

Saito Consensus was invented in the Spring of 2017. Early development focused on assembling a javascript prototype to confirm that the mechanism could be technically implemented. Work building the network began in earnest in 2018, with an initial token sale following in 2021 to raise funding for further development.

The network is currently in a reasonably developed technical state, with a user-facing javascript client, a scalable full-node coded in the Rust programming language, and a suite of useful applications that leverage distributed encryption to power everything from games to social media and communication apps.


### Looking Forward

The network has a nucleus of real usage with a community accustomed to playing games, using the RedSquare social media platform and communicating with our network's set of open source PKI applications. These applications will form the basis for onboarding users and continuing to expand the value offered by the network.

With staking well-tested and token persistence a reality, incentive mechanisms for the release of additional tokens can be finalized, or the outstanding supply can be burned or released into the ATR mechanism in a Bitcoin-style 21-year programmatic release. Core development will finalize consensus variables such the burn-fee algorithm, block time and advanced features like congestion management in the light of real network conditions. Updates and software patches can simply be applied to the rotating blockchain as is routinely done in other networks.

As development work on the applications-front shifts to open source community devs, core development will shift to focus on advanced features like L2 EVMs and base-layer scripting support as nodes are increasingly run by third party and commercial entities. The project retains a leadership role in technical development and advancing the protocol but cedes more management responsibilities to the community for stewardship of the ecosystem.

Any remaining unallocated tokens will be burned or locked-up.

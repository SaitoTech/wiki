# Fileshare

Saito Fileshare is a peer-to-peer encrypted file-streaming service between two peers. Saito Fileshare is a feature within [Saito Chat](https://saito.io/chat/) but can be integrated into any other Saito Application.

## No Limits on Bandwidth

The size of bandwidth is not artificially limited in any way. Because Saito Fileshare only uses the blockchain to establish securely direct connections, all data is transferred only through the route between the two peers.

For this reason the Fileshare module can be considered a standalone application as well as an invaluable utility to be included in other Saito applications.

## How To Send a File

1. Open [Saito Chat](https://saito.io/chat/).
2. Open the Chat settings menu.

3. Copy a URL that contains your *Chat ID* -- give this to your recipient

<img src="/my-chat-id.png" style="width: 600px; padding:10px" />

4. Once the recipient opens this URL, they will add you to their chat list

5. Send them files by clicking on the *Fileshare Button* in their chat box

That's it. Once the sender chooses a file, and the recipient accepts, it will be privately sent across the Internet through a direct peer-to-peer connection, no strings attached.

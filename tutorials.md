# Tutorials

OK... so what do you want to do?

### [User Tutorials](/tutorials/user)

This section has HOWTO guides (with screenshots and walkthroughs!) that show how to do common things like creating a wallet, backing it up, installing modules, adding friends, sending and receiving SAITO, migrating tokens and much more...


### [Dev Tutorials](/tutorials/dev)

Create an application, listen to the blockchain, send-and-receive transactions, save information in the wallet or an archive node, add fancy UI components that update when information is received, query peers for any relevant transactions they might have, and much much more.

### [Game Tutorials](/tutorials/games)

Curious how to play [Twilight Struggle](/applications/twilight) or [Here I Stand](/applications/his) or any of the other games on the Saito Arcade. We have some tutorials explaining how to get started with some of these games. We love them. You will love them.

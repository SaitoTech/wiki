This wiki is a public library of knowledge about Saito Consensus and the Saito network. It offers explanations of how the network works, our design philosophy, and technical information needed to setup a node or start building applications on the network. 

**Why does Saito matter?** 

For the le: build a decentralized blockchain that punishes attackers and rewards the honest infrastructure that keeps the network running. Not just any infrastructure, but the specific kinds that increase fee-throughput. When more fee-throughput is possible, more fees flow into network. When we can use this to raise the cost-of-attack while also increasing scalability? Suddenly we no longer need to sacrifice security to achieve scalability, or vice versa. The economic substructure.

Saito solves this problem: it creates a decentralized blockchain that punishes attackers while rewarding the honest nodes that run the applications and nodes that service users and keep fees flowing into the network. When fees go to these nodes -- not just miners and stakers -- it suddenly becomes rational for peer-to-peer nodes to provide more data-throughput, And as more fees flow through the network in return, this further raises the cost of attack and increases the scalability of the network.

The ability to identify and pay these routing nodes is core to the solution that Saito offers. Because this approach falls outside many assumptions in mainstream blockchain theory -- including several well-known impossibility results in computer science -- it requires clear explanation. The Saito Wiki exists to provide it.

**Users:**

If you’re new to Saito and want to try it out, you can skip this site entirely and visit the [live network](https://saito.io). Users are also encouraged to check out our list of *[Applications](/applications)*  running on the network, as well as our section on *[Smart NFTs](/nfts)*  and the things you can do with them.

**Developers:**

If you are interested in running a node or building applications, you can visit our *[node installationS](/install)* instructions, checkout examples of the *[applications](/applications)* that others are building, and see our list of *[tutorials](/tutorials)* for help getting started.

**Theoretists:**

For the more academically minded, our research section assumes familiarity with distributed systems, collective action problems, and mechanism design. Here you can find material on how Saito works at a deeper level, including descriptions of *[how Saito Consensus works](/consensus)*, how it relates to existing research in both *[economics and computer science](/consensus/theory)*, as well as dedicated pages on Saito-specific solutions such as the approach the network pioneers to punishing *[sybil attacks](/consensus/theory/sybil-attacks)* without sacrificing permissionless routing.

Want to help? This wiki is a community-maintained knowledge base. We could use help keeping our documentation updated, and improving the resources that exist here to help others understand why Saito matters and how they can help us build the world's most powerful and secure permissionless network -- we have a page here on [how to contribute](/community/wiki).

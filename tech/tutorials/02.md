# Tutorial #2 - Sending Transactions and UI Components

This tutorial explains how to build an application that listens for chat messages and parses them when they arrive. When it receives a chat message with a special message inside, it sends its own transaction out onto the network to celebrate. This covers sending and receiving transactions.

## Creating Module Directory

Navigate into your ```/mods``` directory and create a folder with the name ```tutorial02```. Within that directory create the file ```tutorial02.js```. Copy the text below into this this file.

```
var ModTemplate = require('../../lib/templates/modtemplate');
const MainUI = require('./lib/main');

class Tutorial02 extends ModTemplate {

  constructor(app) {

    super(app);

    this.name            = "Tutorial02";
    this.slug            = "tutorial02";
    this.description     = "Transactions and UI Components";

    this.ui              = new MainUI(this.app, this);

    return this;

  }

}

module.exports = Tutorial01;
```

## Creating a UI Component

Modify your application constructor as above. Notice the addition of a UI component that we are calling MainUI. Saito modules can include a ```/lib``` directory which contains subclasses and template files. We create this component in our constructor and update our render() function so that it asks this component to render itself to the screen:

```
  async render() {
    this.ui.render();
  }
  ```

We also add a second function that will send. This 

```
  async sendTutorial02Transaction() {

    let newtx = await this.app.wallet.createUnsignedTransaction();
    newtx.msg = {
      module: this.name,
      data: {
        random : Math.random()
      }
    };
    await newtx.sign();

    this.app.network.propagateTransaction(newtx);

  }
```

We use the function ```createUnsignedTransaction()``` in the Saito wallet to create and return a transaction. This function is normally provided with the address to which you want to send the transaction, and can optionally be provided with fee information. Since none of this information is being provided it defaults to creating a transaction that is addressed to the sender. 

We then fill out the ```msg``` field to contain the information we want to include in the transaction. You can provide whatever information you want -- in this case we'll just generate a random number so that we can see our application is updating and sending a unique transaction every time it is asked.

After we add the information needed we sign the transaction and sent it out into the network using the ```propagateTransaction(newtx)```. This function lives on the network object and broadcasts the transaction to any peers that want to receive transactions.

In a moment we'll go on to talk about the UI Component. Before we do, you should note that most of the functions that our module needs live on the app.* object that is submitted in teh constructor. This contains a number of subclasses (Wallet, Storage, Network, Blockchain) that have functions that perform standard actions like broadcasting transactions or returning addresses. If you are creating a transaction you want the functions that live in the Wallet object.

```
  async processChatTransaction(txmsg) {
    if (this.app.BROWSER) {
      if (txmsg.message) {
        if (txmsg.message.indexOf("huzzah") > -1) {
          alert("Huzzah!");
        }
      }
    }
  }
 ```

## Creating a UI Component

Look in the ```/lib``` directory for the MainUI Class that we have created and defined. The whole text of this file is included below for convenience:

```
const Tutorial02MainTemplate = require('./main.template');

class Tutorial02Main {

  constructor(app, mod) {

    this.app = app;
    this.mod = mod;
    this.name = "Tutorial02Main";

  }

  render() {

    if (document.querySelector("body")) {
      document.querySelector("body").innerHTML = Tutorial02MainTemplate();
    }

    let btn = document.querySelector('.tutorial02-button');
    if (btn) {
      btn.onclick = (e) => {
        alert("sending a transaction!");
        this.mod.sendTutorial02Transaction();
      }
    }

  }

}

module.exports = Tutorial02Main;
```

UI Components in Saito typically have two functions: a ```render(app, mod)``` function which writes content to the screen, and an ```attachEvents(app, mod)``` function. In this situation our module is so simple we .

When the ```render()``` function is executed, the module checks for the existence of an HTML document and writes the HTML returned from its template file into the BODY of that document. This includes a button with the class "tutorial02-button" to which it attaches the event.

As you can see, once the button is clicked, the code in our UIComponent executes and we trigger an alert to notify the user. After that, we call the function ```sendTutorial02Transaction()``` in our main module file. This way of doing things allows UI Components to access any functions that exist in their application module, as well as any functions that are provided by the core Saito classes.

## Reference Materials

Recompile your application and visit the /tutorial02 module in your browser. You will see the button appear and if you click on it you'll get the alert message and your browser will send a transaction into the network.

<img src="/tutorials/explorer.png" style="width:600px" />

If you'd like to confirm your transaction was sent, make sure you are running the ```explorer``` module and visit it to see a list of the latest blocks your machine has produced. You should be able to navigate to the latest block and will be able to find your transaction listed in that block, as per the image above.

As you can see, the data that your module has inserted into your transaction has been included and can be viewed on the blockchain. In our [next tutorial](/tech/tutorial/03), we will modify this application to show how to listen to these transactions and process then when we receive them over the network.

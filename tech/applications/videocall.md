# Video Call

[Saito Talk](https://saito.io/videocall/) is a peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted video conferencing tool for everyday use. And because it is decentralized you don't need to download software, create an account, or provide your phone or credit card number to use it - just create the call and share the link with a friend.

In addition to direct calls, video calls also come with chat channels, and support standard use cases like sharing presentations. You can also now [swarmcast](/tech/applications/swarmcast) your video calls to turn private calls into realtime public broadcasts.

Saito Talk can be accessed directly via the above link or through the slide-in menu that is visible in [Red Square](https://saito.io/redsquare/) and other applications. The animated GIF below shows how easy it is to start a call:

# Saito Testnet

This page describes how to get free tokens on the Saito Test Network - useful for testing and developing applications in a faster environment that is friendlier and cheaper for development work.

## 1. Visit the Saito Testnet Faucet:

https://staging.saito.io/faucet


## 2. Click the "Request Testnet Saito" button

A spinner will appear to acknowledge your request. You should then receive ~100 testnet tokens within a minute or so of submitting your request. If you run into problems, we recommend opening the slide-in menu and clicking "Nuke" to reset your account before submitting your request from a fresh wallet.

## 3. Enjoy your Tokens

The tokens you have on Testnet can only be used on the Saito Test Network, but are otherwise identical to those you will get on the Production network. You can use them with the Saito Vault, Saito Stack or create NFTs using them as you would on mainnet.

# History and Roadmap

Saito Consensus was invented in the Spring of 2017. Early development focused on putting together a javascript prototype to confirm that the mechanism was implementable. Work building the network began in earnest in 2018, with an initial token sale to raise funding for further development in mid-2021.

The network is currently in a reasonably mature technical state, with a user-facing javascript lite-client, a suite of useful applications that leverage the network, and a scalable full node coded in the Rust programming language. Work is ongoing to improve the network client and the applications running atop the network.



### Looking Forward

*September 2025 - December 2026*

The network should have a nucleus of real organic usage around a core set of distributed P2P applications. We will leverage these to scale up our incentive design to incubate a scalable real-world Saito economy. With staking well-tested and token persistence a reality, incentive mechanisms for the release of additional tokens can be finalized, or the outstanding supply can be burned or released into the ATR mechanism in a Bitcoin-style 21-year programmatic release.

Core development will finalize consensus variables such the burn-fee algorithm, block time and advanced features like congestion management in the light of real network conditions. Updates and software patches can simply be applied to the rotating blockchain as is routinely done in other networks.

The project will consider releasing tokens to incentivize application development through the release of an advertising faucet that will get users the tokens necessary to use network nodes and thereby incentivize node operators to roll-out public infrastructure. 

Core application work will shift from specific applications toward infrastructure like transaction archives, advanced block explorers, app stores and node deployment software. We expect nodes to be run for profit by independent node operators, giving users flexibility in switching between providers.

### The Open Era

Saito is a mature open public blockchain. Core development focuses on advanced features like L2 EVMs and base-layer scripting support. Wallets and applications are available for a variety of platforms. Nodes are predominantly run by third party and commercial entities.

Development is increasingly external and community-based. The project retains a leadership role in technical development and advancing the protocol, the community takes increasing responsibiltiy for stewardship of the ecosystem. 

Funding is made available for private-sector development should use cases appear that the community expects will further drive transaction volume and increase security.Â 

Any remaining unallocated tokens will be burned or locked-up.

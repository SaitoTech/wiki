# Install
This page is a directory for installation instruction on officially released Saito clients. This currently includes the Core Rust Client and the the application-focused Saito-lite-Rust Client. Anyone looking to develop applications is recommended the latter.

## Rust

This distribution contains an implementation of Saito Consensus in the Rust programming language. It includes the core code needed to run Saito in any language. Those interested in core consensus code and the implementation that powers Saito at scale look no further.

## Saito-lite-Rust

The 'official' Saito-Lite client written for compatibility with the Saito Rust client and binary data format. Applications found on Saito.io were built and run atop this client, and application developers will find it immediately useful for building peer-to-peer, true Web3 applications.

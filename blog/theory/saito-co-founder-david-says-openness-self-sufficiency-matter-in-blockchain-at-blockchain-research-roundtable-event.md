Saito co-founder David Lancashire was invited to speak at the Blockchain Research Roundtable on September 16th, 2021. The event gathered leading thinkers and researchers in blockchain to discuss blockchain technology with the Blockchainhub Community.

David presented to a panel arguing that **It's Openness, Not Decentralization, That Matters in Blockchain**. He contended that the properties people attribute to decentralization actually stem from opennessâ€”the inability to exclude participants from the chain. He emphasized that openness is not free; we need to fund open data flows that support and allow free competition within the network.

In Bitcoin's original design, volunteers managed this work. However, as these networks scale, the responsibility shifts to for-profit firms in the private sector. Economics has much to say about the significant challenges computer scientists face in this transition. Currently, in every scalable blockchain, miners and stakers are reluctant to operate the network fully, delegating their responsibilities to others. This is evident in the Ethereum network, where many rely on services like Infura.

David outlined three types of solutions in the blockchain industry:

1. **Volunteer Provision**: Networks that depend on volunteers can remain open, allowing anyone to join. However, they cannot scale beyond the capacity that volunteers can support.

2. **Market-Driven Provision**: Inviting the free market to fund the network leads the private sector to create barriers to data sharing to profit, resulting in scalable yet permissioned networks dominated by monopolies at the network layer, as seen with Infura.

3. **Saito's Approach**: Saito replaces mining and staking with a form of work called "routing work," which adds cryptographic signatures at the network layer. This mechanism compensates participants for their contributions, efficiently collecting funds for the network. It is a non-extractive form of work, maintaining the same properties as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems.

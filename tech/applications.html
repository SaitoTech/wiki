<h1>Saito Applications</h1>
<h2>Saito Arcade</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://saito.io/arcade/">Saito Arcade</a> is an open-source game engine that runs as a fully-distributed peer-to-peer (p2p) blockchain application. All the games you can play run directly in the browser using p2p communications to send and receive game moves. Players interact only with each other - there is no central trusted server for deals or storing game data.</p>
<p>This is one of the first open-source software developed by the Saito team. It has been recognized by the Web3 Foundation as a standard for open cryptographic gaming. &nbsp;Also, the arcade works as a showcase for the games/app/chat/forum / AppStore / etc. These are all applications that run in the browser and send-and-receive on-chain data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Red Square</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://saito.io/redsquare/">Red Square</a> (RS) is an integration of the gaming apps that you can find in the arcade, with Social media in a layout similar to Twitter. The games/invites created in the RS will be the same displayed or played in the arcade, the same as the chat that is shared between them. For the posts and likes, everything is stored in the blockchain, which means that every single one of them is a blockchain transaction. The Red Square has played a fundamental role in the increase of the transaction volume (as the blockchain security) since it was launched and provides a new way for the Saitozen to interact.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Games</h2>
<p>There is a good amount of games running on the Saito platform now, and more to come that are currently in development, some of them have been made for members of the community. With Saito being an open-source project that is delighted to receive apps from other developers to run them in the network, this is just the tip of the iceberg for what is to come.</p>
<p>The current list of games are:</p>
<h3>Twilight Struggle</h3>
<p>Twilight Struggle is a card-driven strategy game for two players, with its theme taken from the Cold War. One player plays the United States (US), and the other plays the Soviet Union (USSR). Inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/620/we-people">We the People</a> and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/234/hannibal-rome-vs-carthage">Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage</a>. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?</p>
<p>Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Twilight Struggle is owned by GMT Games. This module is made available under an open source license provided by GMT Games for usage in open source game engines. Publisher requirements is that at least one player per game has purchased a copy of the game.</strong></p>

<h3>Poker</h3>
<p>Texas Hold'em Poker for the Saito Arcade. Is one of the most popular variants of the card game of poker. Two cards, known as hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_card_poker">community cards</a> are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street"). Each player seeks the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands">five card poker hand</a> from any combination of the seven cards; the five community cards and their two hole cards. Players have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betting_in_poker">betting</a> options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Wuziqi</h3>
<p>Wuziqi, or gomuku, also called <i>Five in a Row</i>, is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy_game">abstract strategy</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game">board game</a>. It is traditionally played with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a> pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It is played using a 15×15 board while in the past a 19×19 board was standard. Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, gomoku may also be played as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper-and-pencil_game">paper-and-pencil game</a>. The game is known in several countries under different names.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Red Imperium</h3>
<p>Red Imperium is an open source space-civilization game that uses the base mechanics from the utterly-epic 16-hour boardgame Twilight Imperium. As fans of the original game and its brilliant design, our goal with Red Imperium has been to put something that can help teach newbies how to play, let us practice game strategies and faction rollout, and also just have a fun digital way to get a quick fix between our marathon in-person games. Having a computer automate movement and combat speeds things up to the point the experience is also quite different: a full game can be completed in 2-3 hours and played casually over the course of the day.</p>

<h3>Quake 3</h3>
<p>Quake3 is a multiplayer first-person-shooter originally released by ID Software in 1999. This version runs directly in your browser and connects with Saito to use other Saito applications and bring modules right into the game.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Quake 3 is owned by ID Software. This module is made available under an open source license. Your browser will use data-files distributed freely online but please note that the publisher requires purchase of the game to play. Saito recommends GOG.com for purchase.</strong></p>

<h3>Wordblocks</h3>
<p>A crossword puzzle game, spell out words on the board to earn points. The tiles must form words that, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword">crossword</a> fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns and are included in a standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary">dictionary</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon">lexicon</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Settlers of Saitoa</h3>
<p>Explore the island of Saitoa, collect resources, and build your way to dominance. The players in the game represent settlers establishing settlements on the fictional island of Catan. Players build settlements, cities, and roads to connect them as they settle on the island. The game board, which represents the island, is composed of hexagonal tiles (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_map">hexes</a>) of different land types, which are laid out randomly at the beginning of each game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Players build by spending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics#Resource_management">resources</a> (wool, grain, lumber, brick, and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to reach ten victory points. Players score one point for each settlement they own and two for each city. Various other achievements, such as establishing the longest road and the largest army (by playing the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight">knight</a> cards), grant a player additional victory points.</p>

<h3>Dominion</h3>
<p>Strategy deck-building game: acquire money and land to assert dominion over the realm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a game of <i>Dominion</i>, two to four players compete to gather the most victory points by strategically building a deck of cards. Each player starts with a small deck containing a few weak cards, with which they acquire more cards with different and more powerful abilities. Some provide more of the in-game currency; others let the player perform more actions or buy more cards per turn; others let them draw more cards, harm the other players, remove unwanted cards from their decks, or do other things. As players improve their decks, they also think about how to improve their scores; a powerful deck may be worth no victory points. The game has been compared to the "draft" gameplay style of collectible card games where players vie for the best deck from a common pool of cards.</p>
<p>The game usually ends under one of two conditions: when the stack of Province cards (the highest-value victory card in the base game) has been exhausted, or when any three stacks in the supply have been exhausted. Players then count the number of victory points in their decks, and the player with the highest score wins. Other end-game conditions have been introduced in the game's expansions.</p>
<p>Since possessing victory cards is often necessary to win the game, but they usually have no value during gameplay itself, players must balance the acquisition of victory cards with useful action and treasure cards that maintain the player's ability to play effective turns. Usually, the game's main strategy is to build a deck that maximizes the player's ability to draw hands that can buy the province card (worth 6 victory points and costing 8 coins).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Epidemic</h3>
<p>The goal of Epidemic is for the players, in their randomly selected roles, to work cooperatively to stop the spread of four diseases and cure them before a pandemic occurs.</p>
<p>The game consists of a game board representing a network connecting 48 cities on a world map, two decks of cards (Player cards and Infection cards), four colors of cubes with 24 cubes each (each representing a different disease), six Research Stations, and a pawn for each role. The Player cards include cards with each city name (the same as those on the board); Event cards, which can be played at any time (except for some events in expansions) to give the players an advantage; and Epidemic cards. Infection cards consist of one card for each city on the board and a color of the disease that will start there.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, Infection cards are randomly drawn to populate the board with infections, from one to three cubes for a number of cities. Players start at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, the home of the Centers for Disease Control, and are given a random role and a number of Player cards based on the number of players.</p>
<p>On each player's turn, there are four actions to take up, consisting of any combination of the eight possible actions (some of which require cards, including curing). After taking their actions, the player draws two Player cards, reducing their hand down to seven cards if necessary. If either draw is an Epidemic card, the player moves the Infection rate marker one space, draws a card from the bottom of the Infection deck and places three cubes on that city, puts that card into the Infection discard pile, reshuffles the discard pile, and places it back on top of the Infection deck (so that cards just drawn will come out again soon, unless another Epidemic follows shortly after). After the two Player cards are drawn (Epidemic or otherwise), a number of Infection cards are revealed (increasing throughout the game and corresponding to the Infection rate marker), and one cube of the indicated color is placed on each city drawn. Should a city already have three cubes and a new cube is to be added, an Outbreak occurs, and each interconnected city gains one cube of that color. This can create a chain reaction across many cities if several already have three disease cubes on them. After the infections are resolved, the player on the left has a turn.</p>

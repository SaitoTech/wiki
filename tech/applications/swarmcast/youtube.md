# Swarmcasting on Youtube

You can connect a Swarmcast with YouTube by providing a YouTube Stream Key. Youtube has its own rather unhelpful instructions on how to . Since these are unclear, we're provided more straightforward directions below.

## 1. Visit Youtube

Go to Youtube.com. Click on the top-right menu and select "Youtube Studio".

## 2. Navigate to "Live Streaming" Feature

Click on the "Create" button at the top-right corner of the page. You want to click on the "Go Live" menu option.

NOTE: if this is your first time setting up a swarmcast, Youtube will ask you to enable live streaming for your account -- it usually takes about 24 hours for Youtube to do this, so you should do this at least a day in advance of your first swarmcast. Otherwise, you will be pulled onto a page that asks you to create your stream ID.


## 3. Create a Stream (and get your Stream Key)

# Pandemic

Saito supports an open source clone that implements the gaming logic of the co-operative multiplayer game Pandemic, in which a team of virus hunters and doctors must co=operate to cure a deadly infection.

This module exists as an experiment to develop co-operative gaming application. It is modeled after the VASSAL module that is publicly-available but while it works it is not considered to be in a highly-playable stable.

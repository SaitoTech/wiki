# Development Roadmap

The Saito Roadmap is divided into Four Eras which shift focus from development of the underlying software to distribution of usable apps and growth of an open public ecosystem.

### Rust Consensus

*April 2021 - December 2022 (finished)*

Our first era focused on the development of a standalone Rust-client to replace our javascript prototype. The first version of this Rust client joined the network in November 2021. Application development focused on the Saito Arcade and the development of standard UI components. Our initial supply of ~3 billion SAITO tokens were distributed to adopters to usher in our current period of "zero inflation" and token stability.

### Dawn of Persistence

*January 2023 - December 2024 (expected)*

Our Rust codebase reached enough maturity to compile into a binary form that can run in browsers and applications (WASM). The application suite expanded with the rise of Saito RedSquare and our Video/Chat tools, while gaming activity grew. Token persistence become a reality for large on-network deposits, and the Saito Wallet expanded to support third-party crypto assets.

### The Real Economy

In the current, work on Token Persistence is continuing as the software becomes capable of supporting all on-chain deposits. The network is also shifting to support a circular blockchain that will persist without the need for chain-resets.

The team will continue to work on improving the applications that generate transaction volume, but development tools will allow third-party developers to deploy applications both on their own nodes as well as in wallets that are supported by other network nodes.

The network should have a nucleus of real organic usage around a core set of distributed P2P applications. We will leverage these to scale up our incentive design to incubate a scalable real-world Saito economy. With staking well-tested and token persistence a reality, incentive mechanisms for the release of additional tokens can be finalized, or the outstanding supply can be burned or released into the ATR mechanism in a Bitcoin-style 21-year programmatic release.

Core development will finalize consensus variables such the burn-fee algorithm, block time and advanced features like congestion management in the light of real network conditions. Updates and software patches can simply be applied to the rotating blockchain as is routinely done in other networks.

The project will consider releasing tokens to incentivize application development through the release of an advertising faucet that will get users the tokens necessary to use network nodes and thereby incentivize node operators to roll-out public infrastructure. 

Core application work will shift from specific applications toward infrastructure like transaction archives, advanced block explorers, app stores and node deployment software. We expect nodes to be run for profit by independent node operators, giving users flexibility in switching between providers.

### The Open Era

Saito is a mature open public blockchain. Core development focuses on advanced features like L2 EVMs and base-layer scripting support. Wallets and applications are available for a variety of platforms. Nodes are predominantly run by third party and commercial entities.

Development is increasingly external and community-based. The project retains a leadership role in technical development and advancing the protocol, the community takes increasing responsibiltiy for stewardship of the ecosystem. 

Funding is made available for private-sector development should use cases appear that the community expects will further drive transaction volume and increase security.Â 

Any remaining unallocated tokens will be burned or locked-up.

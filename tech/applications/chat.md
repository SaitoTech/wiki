# Chat

Saito's chat App, like all other apps, runs on top of the Saito blockchain, and it's a Peer to Peer chat, which simply means that it runs between **two computers, phones, or tablets that can share resources and communicate without going through a server(**[**Saito's**](https://saito.io/) **blockchain)**. This means your communication is quick and secure without relying on a messenger to share or peeking at your information.  

To access to Saito Community Chat, which is a public where you can freely talk with other users and members of the Saito team, you only need to open the [Saito Arcade](https://saito.io/arcade/) or [Saito RedSquare](https://saito.io/redsquare/#home) and you will find it at the bottom right of your screen.

But you can also have private chats with anyone that wish using the public key, username, or even by clicking their name on the community chat and then clicking on “Add Contact”, doing this will open another chat window that will be only you and the other user.

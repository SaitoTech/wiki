# Red Square
  
[Red Square](https://saito.io/redsquare/) is the Web 3 public square leveraging the Saito Blockchain and its peer-to-peer capabilities. While it may appear to function like a standard Web 2 Twitter-clone, Red Square's processes have been heavily abstracted down to pure peer-to-peer interactions.
    
For this reason, Red Square achieves what other incumbents like Mastadon or Nostr have failed: an uncensorable public square without reliance on volunteers. Users of Red Square keep each other up to date and can remain online without the permission of any network nodes or central authorities.

Like many Saito applications, Red Square uses a thoughtful mix of on and off chain protocols. Actions like publishing, liking, reposting and following are carried through public transactions while the re-propagation of that information is shared more discreetly between peers.
    
The usual features take on new meaning in Web 3: *Retweeting* actively rebroadcasts the post to other peers, *Following* subscribes to the data-stream of that user, and in an ecosystem with built-in DoS protections, a user's *Likes* are unlimited.

## [DeMod](https://saito.tech/saito-modtools-decentralized-moderation/) - Decentralized Moderation

Red Square is as much the community's go-to hub as it is an experiment on the cutting edge of Web 3. One of the most interesting and difficult questions to answer with any public square, but especially a Web 3 site is: how is content moderated without ceding power to centralized authorities?
  
Red Square is not centralized like *X,* nor is it federated like *Mastadon* or *Nostr,* it is a fully peer-to-peer social media platform. Individual users are the fundamental unit of Red Square, and this is key to answering the challenge of P2P content curation.

**Self Moderation**
  
If a user wishes to hide and refrain from rebroadcasting certain posts or accounts to their peers, they have that choice. As Red Square scales up we expect that being leaders in Web 3 will reveal yet unsolved problems and give way to more sophisticated solutions.
    
Spam and fraud prevention, curation and moderation tools are all ameneties users come to expect, but also the most effective avenues of traditional tech tyranny. Open source and opt-in mechanisms will be required to provide users desiring a more refined experience the ability to have it.

**Distributed Whitelists and Blacklists**

Most users of the internet don't want a highly proactive relationship with content - they simply want good curation. Open-source, distributed whitelists and blacklists for content solve for this: users can subscribe to sensible policies determined by those they trust, but are also freely able to edit, opt-out or otherwise customize their experience.

The benefits and conveniences of platforms performing moderation functions can still be enjoyed, but not without the ability for each individual user to perform personal oversight and take matters into their own hands as they see fit. Rather than a company buyout or state pressure being necessary to change moderation policy, users can create and select for what they personally see fit.

[Community Notes](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/08/16/communitynotes.html) is a great example of an open source tool which allows users to issue corrections on social media without oversight; tools like this will very likely be an important part of Red Square's, and Web 3's future.

# [Red Square](https://saito.io/redsquare/)

The [Red Square](https://saito.io/redsquare/) (RS) is an integration of the gaming apps that you can find in the arcade, with Social media in a layout similar to Twitter. The games/invites created in the RS will be the same displayed or played in the arcade, the same as the chat that is shared between them. For the posts and likes, everything is stored in the blockchain, which means that every single one of them is a blockchain transaction. The Red Square has played a fundamental role in the increase of the transaction volume (as the blockchain security) since it was launched and provides a new way for the Saitozen to interact.Â

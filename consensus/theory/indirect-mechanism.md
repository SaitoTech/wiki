# Why the Revelation Principle Does Not Apply to Saito

Many impossibility results in mechanism design rely on the Revelation Principle, introduced by Roger Myerson in his foundational work on mechanism design (Myerson, 1979; 1981). Informally, the Revelation Principle states that for a broad class of mechanisms, any outcome that can be implemented through techniques that ask participants to take strategic actions in the mechanism can also be implemented by a direct mechanism -- one in which participants simply report their preferences truthfully and the mechanism computes the outcome.

The ability to reduce most indirect mechanisms to direct mechanisms has allowed economists to prove the general impossibility of achieving some outcomes involving efficiency, incentive compatibility, and welfare—optimality in any mechanism that can be converted to a direct mechanism via the Revelation Principle.

As suchIn our section on economics we discuss notable negative results such as the Myerson–Satterthwaite theorem in order to show clearly why these results do not apply to Saito. This page explains more generally why Saito operates outside the domain in which the Revelation Principle applies. Readers should note that the claim is not that the Revelation Principle is incorrect, but that its assumptions do not hold in this setting and thus that all impossibility results that rely on revelation-based reductions do not automatically extend to Saito. 

Readers interested in the formal scope of these results and their assumptions are referred to the economics section of this wiki.

## Pillar 1: Time is Endogenous, Variable, and Payoff-Relevant

In Saito, time is not fixed or external. It is simultaneously:

a utility (faster vs. slower inclusion),

a cost (foregone continuation value, fees, privacy, optionality),

and a feasibility constraint (which outcomes are possible at all).

Crucially, the realized time-to-inclusion is endogenously generated by participant behavior—routing choices, congestion, competition among nodes—rather than fixed by the mechanism in advance.

Participants may form expectations about time, but the mechanism itself does not supply a stable, exogenous quantity of time that can be priced against a common external reference. As a result:

participants do not have preferences over a fixed quantity of time that can be truthfully reported in advance;

valuations for time and for all other goods depend on equilibrium behavior (interdependent valuations);

other preferences (price, privacy, collusion, continuation value) are expressed as trade-offs against time, even though time itself is not a fixed numeraire.

The Revelation Principle assumes well-defined preferences over outcomes that exist prior to interaction and independent of others’ actions. When time is endogenous in this way, that assumption fails.

These limitations are well recognized in the literature on dynamic mechanisms, endogenous feasibility, and costly or constrained communication (e.g., Renou–Tomala).

Pillar 2: Actions Replace Reports; Preferences Are Expressed by Exclusion

In Saito, users do not communicate preferences by reporting them.
They indicate preferences by taking actions that exclude the possibility of making other choices.

This occurs through broadcast and routing strategy, which:

limits who sees a transaction,

excludes potential competitors and bundles,

and makes certain allocations impossible to achieve.

For example:

Broadcasting widely invites competition and faster inclusion, but permanently gives up privacy and certain collusive opportunities.

Routing narrowly preserves privacy or collusion, but permanently gives up competition and speed.

Once a routing decision is made, the alternatives that were not chosen cannot be recovered or reported later. Preferences are therefore revealed through irreversible action, not declaration.

Privacy and Unobservable Information

Privacy fits naturally here. Some payoff-relevant information in Saito is valuable precisely because it is not revealed: intentions, fears of retaliation, strategic ambiguity, or the desire to avoid signaling future behavior. Routing privately preserves this information; making it reportable would destroy its value.

In addition, some of the most important information in Saito is contained in non-events:

who did not receive a transaction,

which competitors never had the opportunity to respond,

which routing paths were never opened.

These absences shape outcomes, but they leave no observable trace that a mechanism can condition on.

Why This Blocks the Revelation Principle

The Revelation Principle assumes that:

agents can costlessly report preferences,

reports do not affect feasibility,

and the mechanism can condition outcomes on all payoff-relevant information.

Saito violates all three:

routing is costly and irreversible;

routing changes the feasible set of outcomes;

payoff-relevant information is contained in unobservable non-events and preserved privacy.

As a result, there is no report the mechanism could ask for that would capture what routing has already done to feasibility. Replacing routing with reporting necessarily changes incentives, so no equivalent direct mechanism exists.

This failure mode is well documented in the literature on costly communication and constrained message spaces. Renou and Tomala, for example, show that when messages are costly or constrained, indirect mechanisms can implement outcomes that no direct mechanism can replicate. Related work on privacy and limited observability similarly notes that direct revelation fails when some payoff-relevant information must remain hidden to retain its value.

Pillar 3: Infinite Combinatorial Complexity of Preferences

Saito involves multiple interacting goods:

blockspace,

time-to-inclusion,

privacy,

collusion opportunities,

continuation value,

risk and uncertainty.

These goods are not quasilinear, trade off against one another, and include time as a continuously variable dimension. A participant’s “preference” is therefore not a single value, but a preference map over infinitely many combinations of goods, timing, and routing outcomes.

Applying the Revelation Principle would require participants to report this entire preference map. Such reports would be:

infinite-dimensional in theory,

impossible to elicit in practice,

and unverifiable by the mechanism.

This limitation is well known in mechanism design: direct revelation breaks down with non-quasilinear utilities, multi-dimensional goods, and continuous choice spaces. Saito simply operates in that region.

Summary

The Revelation Principle is a powerful tool, but it applies only when its assumptions hold. In Saito they do not, because:

Time is endogenous, variable, and payoff-relevant.

Preferences are expressed through costly, feasibility-altering actions, including privacy-preserving exclusion.

Preferences are infinitely multi-dimensional and cannot be fully reported.

These features place Saito outside the class of mechanisms to which revelation-based impossibility results apply. This is not a novel claim about the Revelation Principle itself, but a recognition—supported by existing academic work—that its scope does not include mechanisms with endogenous feasibility, costly action-based signaling, privacy, and continuous multi-dimensional trade-offs.

<h1>Token Supply</h1>
<p>The Saito network has a token supply of 8bb, designed to enter circulation over the next 20+ years. There are currently 3bb SAITO tokens in circulation, primarily in the form of ERC20 / BEP20 tokens that holders can migrate on-chain as needed and which exist for integration with other parts of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
<p>A visual breakdown of Saito's token distribution can be found in <a href="https://saito.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Saito-2023-Tokenomics.pdf">this file</a>.</p>
<p>The network incentive section of the token distribution is the most unique part of Saito's distribution strategy, designed to ensure that token release contributes to driving user adoption and growth without damaging the token value and incentive structure required to bootstrap the network. The tokens in this section will be programmatically released by consensus in tranches over the next 20 years. The community is invited to provide oversight that each tranche is used appropriately prior to release of the next tranche.</p>
<p>The most significant purpose of the network incentives allocation consists of tokens intended to stimulate the ATR mechanism at low-transaction volumes, and funding for a network advertising faucet designed to subsidize application usage and development. The advertising faucet will work by giving a small flow of tokens to users who make transactions on the network. Because the advertising faucet will issue tokens to those using the network, it also requires users to make fee-paying transactions, the fees included in which will be collected by the nodes and devs who are building software and running infrastructure.</p>
<p>Saito's tokenomics distribution and scaling strategy is thus a form of mining where users decide which applications and servers deserve financing from the network. The servers running the applications that attract usage are indirectly subsidized by consensus. Tokens that would be wastefully distributed to stakers or miners in other mechanisms can thus be spent more efficiently and introduced into circulation without debasing the on-chain economy. Meanwhile, the fee flow also secures the network.</p>

<h2>Token Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rust Consensus</strong> (<strong>COMPLETED) </strong>At the end of November 2021 our Rust client should join the network. At roughly the same time we will deploy an upgraded javascript client, giving us two different software stacks that will participate in Saito Consensus.</li>
  <li><strong>The Dawn of Persistence (CURRENT ERA)</strong> Token persistence will become a reality during this era. Staking, while having been possible for some time will begin to earn rewards and token persistence will also come into play.</li>
  <li><strong>The Real Economy</strong> We begin to scale up our incentive design to incubate a scalable real-world Saito economy. With both staking and faucet operations tested, and token persistence gradually expanding, distribution plans and curves for remaining mainnet tokens can be locked-down or a burn schedule set.</li>
  <li><strong>The Open Era</strong> Saito is a mature open public blockchain. Core development work continues on advanced features like L2 EVMs and base-layer scripting support. Wallets and applications are advanced and decoupled from the nodes that deliver them. Nodes are run by diverse operators with no predominant provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Saito Roadmap includes details on when the network expects to support on-chain advertising and other developments that related to the networks' built-in incentive structure. See also the following updates to the project roadmap:</p>

<h2>Where to Buy SAITO</h2>
<p>Saito is available on a number of decentralized exchanges. If you hold Saito you can earn interest from liquidity provision (a form of staking) on these exchanges through the Saito Liquidity Provision Program.</p>

<h2>Migration to Native $SAITO Token</h2>
<p>At the moment you can look into details of bridging ERC20 $SAITO to native tokens at the address below:</p>
<p><a href="https://saito.io/migration/">https://saito.io/migration/</a></p>
<p>In order to ensure stable development and ensure the network is properly handling the rebroadcasting of on-chain assets, migration is limited by the following token persistence curve. This shows the amount that is required to be shifted to the network at various points in time in order to take advantage of migration. Accounts that have less than this specific amount of SAITO will also be at risk of funds loss until token persistence is fully-supported at the end of 2025.</p>

<h1>Wuziqi</h1>
<p>Wuziqi, or gomuku, also called <i>Five in a Row</i>, is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy_game">abstract strategy</a> board game. It is traditionally played with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a> pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It is played using a 15×15 board while in the past a 19×19 board was standard. Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, gomoku may also be played as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper-and-pencil_game">paper-and-pencil game</a>. The game is known in several countries under different names.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Rules</h4>
<p>Players alternate turns to place a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Placing so that a line of more than five stones of the same color is created does not result in a win. These are called overlines</p>

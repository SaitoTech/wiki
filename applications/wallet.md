# Saito Wallet

The Saito Wallet is a general application which adds support for multiple non-Saito cryptocurrencies to the Saito Wallet. The wallet is automatically integrated into the Saito ecosystem, allowing staking of crypto on games in the arcade, sending money to friends via chat and various other feature available to native Saito.

Saito makes it possible to write applications that use tokens and assets on other blockchains. You can code a game that requires a payment to be made in another cryptocurrency, for instance, or a plugin that reads data on other chains. Saito does this by supporting third-party "cryptocurrency modules" that provide a bridge to other networks.

Once your wallet has these modules installed, you will have the option to enable them, at which point the Saito Wallet will provide you with a network address and allow you to send-and-receive tokens on those networks. Right now Saito includes support for Bitcoin and Ethereum by default, but we expect to expand the list as usage grows. The wallet along with the whole Saito software suite is open source, developers interested in getting their favourite cryptocurrency supported are free to do so.

## Getting Started

Once you have installed a cryptocurrency module into your Saito Wallet, you will be able to see the new crypto as an option in the dropdown crypto-select available in your wallet. Simple change to the cryptocurrency that you wish to you. The QRCode in your wallet will update along with the address provided by that module.

You can now use the standard Saito Wallet tools to send and receive crypto. Information on confirmations required and fees required will be provided by the module directly to you via the standard functionality of the Saito Wallet.

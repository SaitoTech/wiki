# Wiki Overhaul


## Psuedo App Store - Dynamically Compiled Module Install

DCM applications should be installable form the wiki.

1. Is it possible to host the files on the Wiki? Yes.
2. Can any install steps be automated?

Here is a DCM file hosted on the wiki: [tutorial01.saito](/tutorial01.saito)

**Problem:** Updating these app files is a pain.

It would be nice if they were just hosted on Github and updated there - Wiki just provides a link to that folder in the repo.

<!--An app can be hosted which fethes and installs from such a link, or installs a user uploaded file for more advanced users wishing to install trustlessly i.e. have access to source code.-->

## "Mod" vs "App" Language

Saito Applications are Saito Modules that have a user interface.

## SLR Developer Structure

"App Development" page that has links to everything a dev needs:

1. Running an SLR Node
2. Configuring
3. Tutorials
4. Docs

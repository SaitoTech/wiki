# Saito Documentation

## Saito Modules

Saito modules are the standard way to develop, serve and run P2P applications. [Saito Lite Rust](https://wiki.saito.io/en/tech/javascript) allows users to easily run any P2P app on a browser lite-node and for full nodes to distribute these applications, provide service and earn transaction fees.

### [Module API](/tech/docs/module-api)
The Module API explains how to include and leverage functions which react to common blockchain, P2P and other events in your module.

### [Events API](/tech/docs/events-api)
he Events API explain how to listen and respond to system-wide events that are triggered when events happen like a new block being found.

### [Services API](/tech/docs/services-api)
The Services API explains how peers can inform other peers that they can be queried for special types of data. 

### [UI Components and Templates](/tech/docs/ui-components) and [CSS Design](/tech/docs/saito-css)

UI Components and CSS Design specifications explain our standard approach for creating UI components that will work and look good regardless of the applications that users are running.

# Saito Roadmap

<p>This document contains our core roadmap and vision. For clarity, we have divided our work into Four Eras which shift in focus from development the core software to focusing on growth of an open public ecosystem.</p>

<h3>Rust Consensus</h3><i>April 2021 - December 2022 (finished)</i>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the Consensus side, our first era focused on the development of a standalone Rust-client which could offer much better scalability than our initial javascript-coded prototype. Our first Rust client joined the network around November 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Applications, our first era focused on rapid experimentation to identify a core suite of applications with promise for driving growth. The Saito Arcade reached a reasonable stage of maturity and development efforted shifted towards experimentation with various games as well as web3 crypto support. Significant work went into iterating and refactoring the underlying platform to allow applications to use a set of standard components with , including the development of standard UI components and menus to simplify application development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Tokenomics, our first era took us from our marketing launch in April 2021 through the vesting of roughly ~3 billion SAITO tokens, which constitute our current market supply. Vesting and distribution was completed by the end of this era, introducing a period of "zero inflation" which has helped ensure token stability.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Dawn of Persistence</h3><i>January 2023 - December 2024 (expected)</i>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consensus work is focused on compiling our Rust client into a WASM bundle that can be embedded into browsers. Improvements are being made to offer greater security in periods of low transaction volume and permit Saito to support NFTs and other kinds of digital assets without the need for standalone VMs. As the name of the era implies, work is also ongoing to support token-persistence on the network. We expect the network to support transfers of small-denominations of Saito by the end of this era.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>App development saw the introduction and interation of RedSquare (our social media platform), a new P2P VideoCall application, and growing sophistication of our more popular games. Work will continue on polishing our core set of applications, with new applications under development by the team and community includind games including "Here I Stand" and "Realms", and supporting applications including digital rights asset management platforms necessary for cartridge-management and IP rental applications. web3 crypto support will become a reality for developers interested in integrating that functionality into their applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<p>In tokenomics, token persistence will become a reality during this era. Staking, while having been possible for some time will begin to earn rewards. The network will pursue a zero-inflation token policy until the third era.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Dawn of Persistence</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Transaction volume will be ramped up through crypto-by-crypto integration into our software stack. Our team will begin development of an advertising faucet and ecosystem. Token allocations for initial staking or advertising purposes will be low and non-disruptive: intended to test the economic model and provide initial support to developers rather than drive scalable economic activity and growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Developer SDK will be launched enabling a switch from internal "dog-fooding" Saito infrastructure to promoting third party development and outreach activities like hackathons and incubated projects. It will be possible to run infrastructure on the network that will keep in sync with our machines across any necessary software upgrades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zero-inflation and growing transaction volume makes this a good time to extend coverage into larger exchanges and trading ecosystems. COVID permitting we will be more publicly engaged at conferences and other events in the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Real Economy</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We begin to scale up our incentive design to incubate a scalable real-world Saito economy. With both staking and faucet operations tested, and token persistence gradually expanding, distribution plans and curves for remaining mainnet tokens can be locked-down or a burn schedule set.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Core development will finalize consensus variables such the burn-fee algorithm, block time and advanced features like congestion management in the light of real network conditions. The team will establish a transparent roadmap for long-term network upgrades with the community.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the application-space, non-project developers will have the ability to easily build and launch applications. Our advertising faucet will provide users with tokens necessary to use the network and incentivize node operators and developers to support public infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>L2 infrastructure: transaction archives, advanced block explorers, app stores and easy deployment stacks will get serious attention. For the first time the majority of these will be run for profit by independent node operators. Users, in turn, will have simple options to choose and switch between providers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saito is well known and the project moves to setting the agenda and running its own events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Open Era</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saito is a mature open public blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Core development work continues on advanced features like L2 EVMs and base-layer scripting support. Wallets and applications are advanced and decoupled from the nodes that deliver them. Nodes are run by diverse operators with no predominant provider. Independent software implementations will start participating in the network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Development is increasingly external and community-based. We seek to retain leadership in technical development and advancing the protocol to provide a coordinating function as routing capacity grows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Project-released software is likely significantly forked and funding can be considered for private-sector development for use cases that will further drive transaction volume and increase security.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Founders and core team continue to be major supporters of the network, but work toward removing any dependence on their roles. Existing entities will be dissolved and any remaining governance moved to a Foundation, staffed by OGs from a variety of backgrounds and who understand Saito and the long term interests of the chain and consensus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unallocated tokens will be burned or locked-up.</p>

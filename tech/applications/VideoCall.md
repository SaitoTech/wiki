# Video Call

[Saito Talk](https://saito.io/videocall/) is a peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted video conferencing software for everyday use. No user account, phone number, credit card or personal information of any kind is required to use it - simply click the link and invite a friend. Saito Talk currently supports up to four callers.
    
[Transient Saito Transactions](https://wiki.saito.io/en/consensus#h-4-automatic-transaction-rebroadcasting-atr) securely bootstraps a STUN connection for the participants based around their public keys. Users then enjoy a fully private, fully encrypted video call independent of the node originally providing STUN services.

We encourage users of centralized conferencing or video call software concerned with privacy and open source values to head over to migrate to Saito Talk - it's only a few clicks away and partners can join via a one-click invitation link.
  
Saito Talk can be accessed directly via the above link or through [Red Square](https://saito.io/redsquare/): click on the hamburger menu and find the *Saito Talk* button:

# Video Call

One of the newest apps of Saito, which allows users all over the world to connect using voice and video streaming, in real-time, for free and running on Saito's blockchain. Currently, this app is still in constant development and testing. This app works in a peer-to-peer manner, allowing for the moment to connect 4 users at the same time.Â 

Since the Video Call app is still improving every day, and Saito team members have moved most of the two-person meetings to the Saito Video Call, Three and four-person call tests are ongoing, and are using our experiences to keep improving stability and usability. Two-person calls are currently stable and we are focused on improving automatic reconnection and other features that become critical in group calls. If you are looking for a great way to help, please assist by testing this feature on your mobile devices and report to us if you have any problems.

# Impossibility Results

Saito Consensus sidesteps several impossibility results that affect other consensus mechanisms and are often treated as defining general limitation on all distributed consensus mechanisms. 

The solution suggests general strategies exist for achieving incentive compatibility in informationally decentralized mechanisms, and offers a rebuttal to the following frequently-cited impossibility results from economics and computer science, showing that while these papers may be correct **within the bounds of their assumptions** -- those assumptions are not universally binding on distributed consensus mechanisms.

### 1. On Bitcoin and Red Balloons (2011)

An influential [academic paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.2626) by Moshe Babaioff, Shahar Dobzinski, Sigal Oren and Aviv Zohar has claimed the impossibility of building distributed mechanisms which incentivize transaction propagation. Their paper specifically asserts that "there are no reward schemes in which information propagation and no self-cloning is a dominant strategy."

Saito Consensus solves this problem, offering a routing payout to P2P nodes that encourages nodes to share transactions with their peers, yet does not make self-cloning rational. The solution works because adding hops to transactions decreases the usefulness of those transactions for producing blocks, reducing the expected income of the attacker by more than the attacker can expect to earn through the expanded claim on payout from an additional routing hop. One assumption from this paper that Saito Consensus violates is the expectation that all nodes must have an equal probability and thus cost of producing the most efficient next block.

We have a [mathematical proof](https://github.com/SaitoTech/papers/blob/e32c51db6aae071a41b7e481d0f5ba6cd75ec12d/sybil/A_Simple_Proof_of_Sybil_Proof_Lancashire-Parris_2023.pdf) that routing work solves this problem in a three-hop routing path. To our knowledge the routing-decay and probabilistic payout solution offered by Saito Cosnensus remains the only known solution to this problem.

### 2. Roughgarden and Shi (2020)

Various papers from Tim Roughgarden (Colombia) and Elaine Shi (Cornell) and their colleagues have claimed for several years that it is impossible to build incentive compatible blockchains. The very first paper from Shi is technically correct, but is non-applicable as it limits its analysis to direct mechanisms in which the transaction fee pays for a single (non-combinatorial) form of value.

This first problem invalidates the paper as a general impossibility result since in blockchains the transaction fee is explicitly a non-scalar value that expresses a joint preference over a combinatorial bundle of utility that includes the value the user assigns to the multiple kinds of utility that can be purchased: blockspace and security, speed-of-confirmation, and any form of off-chain utility that can be secured through exclusive access for the right to collect the fee.

The fact that transaction fees are "non-scalar" breaks these papers fundamentally -- co-mingled valuations prevent us making any assumptions about the monotonicity of the fee and prevent the use of the techniques in implementation theory (like the Revelation Principle) that the authors of these papers draw on to offer their impossibility results.

A second more fundamental problem is the assumption of these models that block producers can "faithfully implement" incentive compatible mechanisms without revealing their own private preferences to the mechanism. Not only is such preference revelation not required of producers in these models, but it is explicitly forbidden (the papers assume that honest implementation is incompatible with producers putting transactions into their blocks). This oversight pushes these papers into internal-contradiction, as you cannot simultaneously require block producers to reveal preferences yet block the channel through which it can happen (the inclusion of self-generated transactions in blocks).

This oversight pushes the solution out-of-model. In Saito Consensus users are motivated to bid honestly exactly because competition exists from producers: bid too low and producers will switch from being sellers to buyers of blockspace because of their desire to purchase faster transaction inclusion! This solution is only possible because the transaction fees are non-scalar and the blockchain is implicitly a combinatorial auction -- producers must have a rational reason to purchase blockspace that is different from users.

On a closing note, we also observe that all of the academic papers in this area fail to properly identify their social choice rule. While they implicitly adopt the rule of the Vickrey auction ("efficient allocation") they seem unaware this rule cannot be implemented by any mechanisms in which the supply of utility available for distribution changes based on the strategies used by agents in the mechanism. In the language of implementation theory, the fact that the supply of utility is dependent on peer strategy creates problems with "interdependent valuations" that prevent the ability to offer impossibility results.

Switching to the appropriate social choice rule for two-sided auctions ("efficient allocation and production") allows mechanisms to handle a variable supply of utility but forces us into requiring higher-dimensional preference revelation as both supply and demand-side preferences must be disclosed for any direct mechanism to implement welfare-optimal outcomes.  The papers cannot mathematically model this using the techniques they attempt to use, which makes them methodologically incapable of drawing the conclusions they do.

We close by observing that in Saito Consensus we do see proper -- if indirect -- preference revelation. users reveal their preferences through both the fee they choose and the broadcast strategies they use to share their transactions with peers in the network. Producers reveal their own preferences through their willingness to add their own fee-flow to blocks, effectively redirecting surplus profits from the sale of collusion goods into a subsidy that drives the faster inclusion valued more highly by other agents in equilibrium.

### 3. Bracha and Toueg (1985)

The paper *Asynchronous Consensus and Broadcast Protocols* by Bracha and Toueg shows that in an asynchronous system with **n** total processes, at most **(nâˆ’1)/2** processes can be adversarial. Their model assumes a network of processes that receive and respond to network messages automatically:

> In an atomic step of the system, a process can try to receive a message, perform an arbitrarily long local computation, and then send a finite set of messages. The computation and the messages sent are prescribed by the protocol, that is, a function of the message received and the local state.

In Saito Consensus the cost of proposing a block varies for different node in the network. And the probabiliy of winning the payment available to routing nodes also varies for block producers based on the efficiency with which they have sourced the transactions included in the block. These two costs do not move in unison for all nodes in the network, and making it faster and less expensive for nodes to propose blocks that contain more welfare efficient set of transactions.

It stops being that messages which reduce the overall efficiency of fee-throughput are symmetrically costly to those which do not.

### 4. Roger B. Myerson and Mark A. Satterthwaite (1983)

The paper *Efficient Mechanisms for Bilateral Trading* by Roger B. Myerson and Mark A. Satterthwaite prove that it is impossible to achieve incentive compatibility in any bilateral trading (direct) mechanism, with results that are extensible through the Revelation Principle to any two-sided mechanism with multiple participants that can be reduced to a direct mechanism.

Saito Consensus is an indirect mechanism that is not reducible to a direct mechanism via the Revelation Principle. This impossibility emerges because conversion would require agents to reveal their supply and demand preferences at all prices levels for an effectively infinite combination of collusion and in-network goods and on an infinitely granular time preference curve.

The informational problem that makes conversion impossible is not just the extreme multi-dimensionality of the preferences which must be revealed to the mechanism. It also emerges from the way the individual preference curves end up jagged and discontinuous because of the potential for participants to shift temporarily at arbitrary points between being producers and consumers of different combinations of goods, creating jagged spikes that cannot be assumed not to exist if agents have not fully revealed their preference. The fact that the "hinge" good that permits the trade-offs to be made efficiently is infinitely granular (time preference) then blocks generalizing assumptions that could otherwise assist in compressing the preference space into a finite representation.


### 5. Leonid Hurwicz (1972)

Hurwicz's seminal paper *The Design of Mechanisms for Resource Allocation* pointed out that in informationally decentralized mechanisms where communication between agents is needed prior to resource allocation, only mechanisms that can induce participants to share private preferences truthfully can be considered *incentive compatible* (i.e. robust to strategic manipulation by rational agents in expectation).

> These results show that the difficulty is due not to our lack of inventiveness, but to a fundamental conflict among such mechanism attributes as the optimality of equilibria, incentive-compatibility of the rules, and the requirements of informa- tional decentralization. Concessions must be made in at least one of these directions.

In Saito Consensus, the "pre-exchange messaging step" that is needed for agents to form price expectations and thus strategies is mediated through the blockchain itself and can only be manipulated through the sending of fee-bearing messages. And the cost that the publisher of this message must pay increases if it pushes the network into a less efficient equilibrium.

The cost of speech now depends on the content of the message. An asymmetrically higher cost is charged for false speech (state transitions which push us away from welfare-optimal outcomes), undermining the impossibility of implementing those equilibria in informationally decentralized conditions. Saito Consensus achieves incentive compatibility by fulfilling the requirements Hurwicz establishes through the indirect and decomposable optimization process he referred to generally as the "Greed Process".

### Conclusion

The foundational impossibility results that computer scientists and economists developed in the 1970s and 1980s emerged out of the assumption that *processes* in computer systems were purely technical processes that could be costlessly manipulated by attackers. This resulted in the emergence of impossibility results based on the assumption that *malicious processes* could not be punished within consensus mechanisms as soon as they the same implicit "voting power" as honest nodes.

This assumption remains true in proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanisms, since those mechanisms lose the ability to punish attackers in majoritarian conditions. But there is no reason to consider this problem unsolvable. Subsequently impossibility results have not gone back to revisit the fundamentals examined in the 1980s, and have instead assumed that they must continue to hold, despite the shift to mechanisms that maintain their own unit-of-value and can punish participants without reference to external cost structures.

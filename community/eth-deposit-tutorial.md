# How to deposit Eth to a Saito Wallet

## Depositing

Saito.io node supports feeless Eth transfers within its node network. Before sending Eth, be sure you are using a Saito.io node or that the node you are using has the same support.

You can be sure that any time the domain begins with https://Saito.io, that feeless inter-network Eth transfers are supported.

Getting Eth into your Saito Wallet is similar to getting Eth into other self-custodial crypto wallets:

4. Send Eth to your Saito Wallet Ethereum address.


If you followed the steps, you should see your Eth balance in the Saito Wallet as soon as it is confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain. Once the Eth is deposited into your Saito Wallet, all Eth transfers within Saito Network are free and fast!

This makes paying your friends or wagering Eth in games simple - we hope you enjoy the experience. Donâ€™t forget to securely backup your Saito wallet, which will save your private keys as well as your contacts and other important data.

## <div id="backup">Backing Up</div>

There are two primary ways to backup your wallet:

1. Encrypt Wallet and upload to Saito

Open the hamburger menu like in <a href="#step1">step 1</a>, and press the **ACCOUNT** button. A settings menu will appear with many options.

Press the **Backup Wallet** option near the top, and save the file. This wallet file includes your Saito private key as well as your other crypto private keys, contacts and other important wallet data.

**Note:** Backup your wallet - do not just save your private key! Your Saito private key does not contain information about your other crypto keys, so it is imperative that you backup the entire wallet and not just the private key!

2. Allow Saito to Automatically Help

When adding a new crypto, or creating a new contact (key exchange), Saito will automatically ask you if you want help backing up your wallet. By providing an email and password, you will recieve an encrypted file which will allow you to recover the wallet.

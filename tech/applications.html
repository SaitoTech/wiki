<h2><a href="https://saito.io/arcade/">Saito Arcade</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://saito.io/arcade/">Saito Arcade</a> is an open-source game engine that runs as a fully-distributed peer-to-peer (p2p) blockchain application. All the games you can play run directly in the browser using p2p communications to send and receive game moves. Players interact only with each other - there is no central trusted server for deals or storing game data.</p>
<p>This is one of the first open-source software developed by the Saito team. It has been recognized by the Web3 Foundation as a standard for open cryptographic gaming. &nbsp;Also, the arcade works as a showcase for the games/app/chat/forum / AppStore / etc. These are all applications that run in the browser and send-and-receive on-chain data.&nbsp;</p>

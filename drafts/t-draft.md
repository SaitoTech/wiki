# Token Supply

The Saito Network has a maximum token supply of 7bb, which has been reduced two times so far from an initial supply of 10bb.

There are currently 3bb SAITO tokens in circulation, primarily in the form of ERC20 / BEP20 tokens that holders can migrate on-chain as needed and which exist for integration with other parts of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The tokens not in circulation are reserved to aid in parts of the roadmap where the goal is to spur activity and organic security on the network - these outstanding tokens may be used as a block-builder security fund, token faucets, or developer/user incentives.

- **Note:** any tokens reserved for network incentives are to be released on a schedule conducive to healthy price action. Any tokens not burned will be released gradually over a **twenty year period**.

As the roadmap has progressed without the need for these tokens, they have been burned. Most notably, the release of our low-fee security mechanism and increased adoption in the Summer of 2024 sparked the 12.5% burn to 7bb total tokens.

# Saito Consensus

Saito Consensus is a distributed consensus mechanism provably secure against a specific type of [routing attack](/consensus/sybil-attacks) previously considered impossible to solve. This solution allows the network to issue a routing payment. The existence of this routing payment can be leveraged to sidestep several traditional [impossibility results](/consensus/impossibility-results) in economics and computer science. This page offers a brief overview of how the mechanism works.

## 1. HOW BLOCKS ARE PRODUCED

When users send transactions into the network they add cryptographic routing signatures which specify the first-hop node(s) to which they are sending their transactions. Nodes add similar signatures as they relay these transactions onwards to their own peers. As a result, all transactions included in blocks contain an unforgeable record of the path they have travelled from their originating user to the node that included it in a block.

Nodes compete to collect transactions to secure a kind of "routing work" that is used to produce blocks. The amount of routing work in any transaction consists of the transaction fee halved with every hop beyond the first that the transaction has travelled into the network. A transaction with a 10 SAITO fee offers 1st-hop nodes 10 units of routing work, 2nd-hop nodes 5 units of routing work, 3rd-hop nodes 2.5 units of routing work, and so on.

Consensus adjusts the amount of "routing work" that nodes needs to propose blocks to target a desired blocktime: if blocks are produced more rapidly the "burn fee" rises, and if blocks are produced more slowly the "burn fee" falls. This difficulty criteria is known as the "burn fee" as once the block is produced all of the fees paid by the transactions within it are burned. This establishes a baseline cost that must be paid in equilibrium to propose a block.

## 2. HOW NODES ARE PAID

Once a block is produced a hashing competition begins. The competition works similarly to the mining puzzle in proof-of-work, except that instead of competing for the right to produce blocks, miners are competing for the right to resurrect and distribute the fees that were burned in the previous block.

If a golden ticket for block N is included in the very next block (N+1), consensus divides those fees between the miner that found the solution and a random routing node from the routing paths of one of the transactions in the previous block. The block producer is eligible to win as the last hop in the routing path of every transation, but other nodes may win as well.

The lottery first selects a transaction from the block, with each transaction weighted by its share of overall fees in the block. The random solution is then hashed again to select a routing hop from the winning transaction, with each hop weighted by its share of routing work in the path. For a transaction with a 2-hop routing path and a 10 SAITO fee, the 1st-hop has a 10/5 chance of payout while the 2nd-hop has a 5/15 chance. In a transaction with a 3-hop routing path and a 10 SAITO fee the 1st-hop has a 10/17.5 chance of payout, while the 2nd-hop has a 5/17.5 chance of payout and the third has a 2.5/17.5 chance of payout, etc.

This process repeats block by block. Nodes burn in-network tokens to produce blocks, and then burn ex-network hash to resurrect them. Hashing difficulty adjusts upward if two blocks in a row are produced with golden tickets, and downwards if two blocks in a row are produced without golden tickets. This basic implementation achieves cost-of-attack at the price of significant deflationary pressure from the blocks whose fees are burned but never resurrected and redistributed by a golden ticket.

## 3. AUTOMATIC TRANSACTION REBROADCASTING (ATR)

ATR divides the blockchain into epochs of N blocks. Once a block falls out of the current epoch, its unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) become unspendable. But any UTXO which meet rebroadcast criteria must be re-included in the next block in ATR transactions. These transactions include the original transaction as embedded data, but provide new UTXO spendable by the original address.

The criteria for rebroadcasting is that the UTXO is unspent and contains enough tokens to pay a rebroadcasting fee. The rebroadcasting fee is equal to or greater than the average fee per byte paid by new transactions over the previous epoch.

The UTXO may also be issued a staking payout on rebroadcasting. This ATR payout improves cost-of-attack by pulling fees away from attackers who spend their own money to produce blocks. It also improves censorship-resistance because attackers who prevent users from making transactions are forcing them into a state where the attacker must transfer them income. In addition to the economic and security benefits of this approach, we note that permissionless and permanent data storage finally becomes possible and economically sustainable through this mechanism. Anyone who wants the blockchain to store their data in perpetuity need only attach a large enough UTXO that the ATR payout issued matches or is greater than the ATR fee collected.

## 4. MISCELLANEOUS IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

The above description is a "pure" version of routing work that has several drawbacks: deflation is required to maintain security in equilibrium, cash-only attacks are possible, and extremely rich attackers may try to bias lottery payouts through strategies that radically increase the 

These problems can be mitigated with the following modifications, which are implemented by:

* have consensus require all valid chains to contain N golden tickets over the last M blocks. This prevents cash-only attacks at the cost of letting attackers slow the network down if they are capable of driving up mining difficulty artificially and then withholding hash to slow block production.

* require block producers to affix tokens to blocks when proposing them, permitting the identification of attacker-held tokens and their slashing in the event of a social fork. This provides a deterrence to cash-only attacks.

* when a golden ticket is included in a block (N), calculate the winner of block (N-1) as described above, but if block (N-1) did not contain a golden ticket recurse backwards to issue a router payout for the second unpaid block (N-2), while distributing the miner payout for this second block in a special ATR treasury. this prevents deflation caused by variance in the speed at which mining solutions can be found. it may theoretically make the tip block in the blockchain less stable.

* issue the funds in the ATR treasury as payments to unspent UTXO as part of the ATR mechanism described in the next section. If these unspent UTXO are well distributed (not fully controlled by the attacker), the ATR payout further increases cost-of-attack on the network as any attacker who is spending their own tokens must necessarily redirect a portion of their own wallet to any users whose transactions they are censoring.

* maintain a smoothed average of the fees included in each block over the last epoch in the block header. In the event that any router payout spikes well in excess of this average (1.5x in production) cap payout at this level. This prevents an edge-case attack on the payout lottery attackers willing to flood the network with massive amounts of their own deep-routed tokens to marginally improve their payout odds.

* affix cryptographic routing signatures to blocks to permit nodes to identify and deprioritize messages from other nodes which have been observed to violate routing policies.


### APPENDIX I: SAITO TERMINOLOGY

**Genesis Period:** the length of the epoch in number of blocks.

**Golden Ticket:** a transaction from a miner containing a valid solution to the computational lottery puzzle embodied in the previous block hash.

**Routing Work:** the quantifiable amount of work that a specific transaciton offers a specific node for meeting the block-production criteria of the network, specifically the value of the fee paid halved with each hop beyond the first that the transaction has needed to reach the specific node.

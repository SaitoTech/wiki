<h1>Mahjong</h1>
<p><strong>Mahjong solitaire</strong> (also known as <strong>Shanghai solitaire</strong>, <strong>electronic</strong> or <strong>computerized mahjong</strong>, <strong>solitaire mahjong</strong> or simply <strong>mahjong</strong>) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-player_video_game">single-player</a> matching game that uses a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong_tiles">mahjong tiles</a> rather than cards. It is more commonly played on a computer than as a physical tabletop game.</p>
<p>Its name comes from the four-player game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong">mahjong</a>, but it is played entirely differently.</p>
<h2>Play</h2>
<p>An untouched turtle formation, with exposed "free" tiles highlighted in blue</p>
<p>The 144 tiles are arranged in a four-layer pattern with their faces upwards. A tile is said to be open or exposed if it can be moved either left or right without disturbing other tiles. The goal is to match open pairs of identical tiles and remove them from the board, exposing the tiles under them for play. The game is won when all pairs of tiles have been removed from the board, and lost if the remaining tiles contain no exposed pairs.</p>
<h3><strong>Mathematical analysis</strong></h3>
<p>Playing Mahjong solitaire optimally in the sense to maximize the probability of removing all tiles is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPACE-complete">PSPACE-complete</a>, and the game is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete">NP-complete</a> if looking below tiles is allowed. It has been proven that it is PSPACE-hard to approximate the maximum probability of removing all tiles within a factor of nE, assuming that there are arbitrarily many quadruples of matching tiles and that the hidden tiles are uniformly distributed. The perfect-information version of this puzzle is where the player knows, before the game starts, the position of every tile. In this case, however, it is NP-complete to decide whether all tiles can be removed.</p>
<p>An analysis of ten million games with the default layout, "the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turtle_(Shanghai_solitaire)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">turtle</a>", found that about 3 percent of the turtles cannot be solved even when looking below tiles is allowed.</p>

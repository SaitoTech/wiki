# Red Imperium

Red Imperium invites two to six players to lead one of eight unique factions in a quest for control over the galaxy. Success relies on military strength, diplomatic cunning, and savvy economic planning. Only one will ultimately triumph and rule a new thousand-year empire from the seat of New Byzantium.

Each faction available for play offers a distinct style of play, with some factions benefiting from bonuses in space combat, while others have slight advantages in trade or the development of critical technologies. The board for every game is also uniquely constructed from tiles that represent everything thriving industrial and commercial worlds to dangerous space anomalies like black holes and impenetrable asteroid belts. As the game advances, factions also vote on new laws and develop new technologies that will change the rules of the game and the scope of what is possible.

Saito supports games of different length. We recommends games with 10-14 Victory Points f

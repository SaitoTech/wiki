<h1>Solitrio</h1>
<p>Once you've started playing Solitrio, how can you go back to old-fashioned Solitaire? This one-player card game is the perfect way to pass a flight from Hong Kong to pretty much anywhere. Arrange the cards on the table from 2-10 ordered by suite. Harder than it looks.</p>
<h3>How to play:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cards (2-10 in each suit) are randomly arranged in four rows of ten with four blank spaces.</li>
  <li>The goal is to arrange the cards in sequential order with one suit per row.</li>
  <li>The 2 of any suit may be placed in the leftmost space of any row (if empty).</li>
  <li>All other cards must match the suit of its left neighbor and be the next in sequence, e.g. the 8♠ may be placed after (to the right of) the 7♠.</li>
  <li>If you get stuck, you may reshuffle the board. Reshuffling will not move a 2 (or any connected sequence of cards) from its target position.</li>
  <li>You only have two chances to reshuffle the board and you lose if you cannot order the cards.</li>
</ul>

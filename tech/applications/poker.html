<p>Saito Poker is a implementation of &nbsp;Texas Hold'em Poker that uses advanced cryptographic techniques to allow players to play the game in a provably-fair fashion without the need for a trusted third-party.</p>
<p>Saito Poker is fundamentally different from other “web3” poker implementations which allow players to use cryptocurrencies to make wagers, but which rely on centralized servers or trusted third-parties to deal cards, manage betting, and handle payouts. With Saito all gameplay is provably fair and occurs directly between players using peer-to-peer cryptographic techniques.</p>
<p>The techniques used to secure poker are available in all other games as well, provided by the Saito Game Engine which underpins most of the game modules. This engine implements poker-friendly techniques like [mental poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker), as described by Adi Shamir, Ronald L. Rivest and Leanard M. Adleman – the inventors of public key cryptography. These techniques exploit the commutative properties of public key encryption schemes to encrypt and shuffle cards in such a way that cards cannot be dealt from the deck without all players sharing their portion of the decryption keys. &nbsp;the keys of each player, and then progressively decrypt card when they must be revealed.&nbsp;<br><br>&lt;img src="/mentalpoker.png" alt="Mental Poker; Adi Shamir, Ronald L.

<p>Saito Poker is under development, but already supports most featured needed for a fun game. Players can join or leave tables, and easily stake real-world cryptocurrencies supported by the Saito Wallet. Whereas these steps require a trusted party like Facebook in other systems, Saito removes trust assumptions from the network infrastructure, allowing scalable and permissionless gameplay.</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>At the start of each turn, two “hole cards” are dealt face down to each player. Five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_card_poker">community cards</a> are then dealt face-down on the table and revealed in three stages ("the flop", “the turn”, and then “the river”). Once all cards have been revealed, the winner is the player with the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands">poker hand</a> created using any combination of their seven cards.</p>
<p>Betting occurs in stages throughout the game. A single round precedes the revelation of any community cards, and then a single round following each one. In all of these stages players can check, call, raise, or fold.</p>

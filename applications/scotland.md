# Scotland Yard

![](/img/scotland.jpg)

Scotland Yard is a classic boardgame in which one or more players cooperate to control the London Police force, tracking a nefarious criminal through the streets, subways and canals of London. If at any time the position of the police overlap on the board with the criminal, the game is won by the forces of law and order.

While all players are limited in how they can move around a gorgeous map of the city of London, at five specific points in the game, the criminal must publicly reveal their position. At this point, detectives may adjust their strategy and plan ways to encircle the criminal. 

The Saito implementation is similar to the VASSAL module, released open source and intended for owners of the classic game who wish to play a digital copy.

# Join the Community

[RedSquare](http://saito.io/redsquare) is our on-chain web3 hub. Visit RedSquare to find and chat with the Saito team, OGs, and all members of the community. As with all Saito Applications, when you run these apps your browser will automatically generate a wallet and synchronize a lite node, so you can join the conversation instantly:

<br>
<div style="height:400px;width:600px;overflow:hidden;">
  <img src="/red-square-feed.jpg">
</div>

While we recommend newbiews to ynchronize a lite node, so you can join the conversation instantly:

<h1>Token Supply</h1>
<p>The Saito network is designed for a max token supply of 10bb. There are currently 3bb SAITO tokens in circulation. These are mostly ERC20 / BEP20 tokens that holders can migrate on-chain as needed and which exist for integration with other parts of the cryptocurrency ecosystem like exchanges.</p>
<p>In the future, additional token supply may be made available to a community-controlled foundation (20%), allocated to fund core software development (10%), earmarked to provide liquidity to strategic partners who bring industrial use-cases to the network (10%), as well as to incentivize consumer usage through an on-chain Advertising Faucet (10%) that will funnel small amounts of SAITO to users while the network builds transaction volume.</p>
<p>The advertising faucet is the most unique part of Saito's distribution strategy. Giving a small flow of tokens to users who make transactions on the network subsidizes usage without allowing users to accumulate significant reserves. Because the advertising faucet will issue tokens in exchange for using the network, it also requires users to actively make fee-paying transactions, the fees in which will be collected by the nodes and devs who are building software and running infrastructure. Saito's tokenomics distribution strategy is thus a form of mining where users decide which applications and devs deserve financing from the network. Tokens that would be distributed to stakers or miners in other mechanisms can thus be spent more efficiently and introduced into circulation without debasing the on-chain economy. Meanwhile, the fee-flow also secures the network.</p>

<h2>Token Roadmap</h2>
<p><strong>Rust Consensus</strong> At the end of November 2021 our Rust client should join the network. At roughly the same time we will deploy an upgraded javascript client, giving us two different software stacks that will participate in Saito Consensus.</p>
<p><strong>The Dawn of Persistence</strong> Token persistence will become a reality during this era. Staking, while having been possible for some time will begin to earn rewards and token persistence will also come into play.</p>
<p><strong>The Real Economy</strong> We begin to scale up our incentive design to incubate a scalable real-world Saito economy. With both staking and faucet operations tested, and token persistence gradually expanding, distribution plans and curves for remaining mainnet tokens can be locked-down or a burn schedule set.</p>
<p><strong>The Open Era</strong> Saito is a mature open public blockchain. Core development work continues on advanced features like L2 EVMs and base-layer scripting support. Wallets and applications are advanced and decoupled from the nodes that deliver them. Nodes are run by diverse operators with no predominant provider.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://org.saito.tech/saito-roadmap-update/">Saito Roadmap</a> includes details on when the network expects to support on-chain advertising and other developments that related to the networks' built-in incentive structure.</p>
<p>After this big update of the roadmap, and during the period of 2022, Saito community received two more detailed updates of the Roadmap and the current state of the project development. These are:</p>

<h2>Where to Buy SAITO</h2>
<p>Saito is available on a number of decentralized exchanges. If you hold Saito you can earn interest from liquidity provision (a form of staking) on these exchanges through the <a href="https://org.saito.tech/buying-selling-and-staking-saito-live-on-pancakeswap/">Saito Liquidity Provision Program</a>.</p>

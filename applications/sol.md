# Solana

Solana support on the Saito Network is available through the installation of this module. As Solana support is handled through the Mixin module, installation of that module is required as a prerequisite.

Users should note that the cryptographic keys needed to transfer SOL on the Saito network are stored in your wallet. This means you should back-up your full wallet after creating an Solana address, to ensure you have a backup of the information needed to recover the account. If you restore a Saito wallet by importing only the private-key associated with your Saito, you will not restore these keys and may be unable to move your SOL.

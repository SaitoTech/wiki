## Gaming

The [Saito Arcade](https://saito.io/arcade/) is an open source game engine that runs as a fully-distributed peer-to-peer blockchain application in the browser. Many of the games leverage sophisticated cryptographic [techniques](#mental-poker) to ensure fair elements of chance can exist without any third-party oversight.



Games on Saito require some of the most advanced use of Saito's cryptographic suite in order to ensure fair play in **genuine, peer-to-peer Web 3** (rather than a centrally hosted [Gacha-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game) game with token integrations). 
The Arcade not only laid the groundwork for a more diverse suite of peer-to-peer applications but represents what we believe to be some of the richest Web 3 experiences online.

All games, whether they rely on complex cryptographic interactivity or are simple single-player experiences, benefit from the Saito Consensus's natural ability to fund open source applications by allowing service providers to earn their share of payment for network bandwidth or service provided.

For these reasons the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/) has recognized the Saito Game Engine as a standard for open, cryptographic gaming, where it succesfully [applied](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/saito-game-protocol-and-engine.md) and fulfilled requirements for its grants program.

> I like this idea and think it provides something REALLY valuable to the ecosystem, and takes blockchain gaming in a very different (and good!) direction

## Core Apps

Saito Applications are programs that run directly in your browser. These applications have a built-in wallet and use the Saito network to communicate with peers. See our full list of [available programs](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/tree/master/mods) or our [tutorials](/tech/tutorials) on how to develop a module from scratch, or check out our flagship applications below.

## Games

There is a good amount of games running on the Saito platform now, and more to come that are currently in development, some of them have been made for members of the community. With Saito being an open-source project that is delighted to receive apps from other developers to run them in the network, this is just the tip of the iceberg for what is to come.

## Build Your Own

Those interested in building on Saito should start [here](/tech/building_apps). The SDK used to make the all apps on this page is fully available for anyone to begin using. It has built-in functions to interact with the blockchain, perform basic cryptography, establish peer-to-peer connections and more. Applications are built using Javascript and run in the browser.

Many of the beloved Saito apps like [Beleaguered Castle](/tech/applications/BeleagueredCastle) and even [Red Square](/tech/applications/RedSquare) were built or spurred to life by community members. Any developers seeking assistance or who want to offer feedback can reach the lead developers on [Red Square](https://saito.io/redsquare/), [Saito Community Chat](https://saito.io/chat/), [Saito Community Telegram](https://t.me/SaitoIO) or make an [issue](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/issues) on the Github. The team is thrilled to see what the community builds and values developer feedback.

# Community Resources

Want to help out or join the community?

## Help with Stuff that is Hard?

As an open source project, there is no shortage of things that need doing. If you know how to code or want to get involved, you can literally pick any project or application. 

We also have a list of [harder tasks](/community/tasks) that it would be nice to see someone pick up and run with. If you're a genius with spare mental cycles, why not check out some of these problems and see if you can help us make headway.


## Help with Stuff that is Fun?


One of the easiest ways is get involved is to visit [RedSquare](https://saito.io/redsquare) our peer-to-peer social media site. Not only can you ask questions or learn more about the network, but you can experience a genuine peer-to-peer social experience and get a better sense of why distributed PKI apps are the future.

Another popular hangout for the community is the [Saito Arcade](https://saito.io/arcade). Although the Arcade is technically running 24/7 and you can find games almost constantly recently, we have various [game nights](/community/game_nights) and tournaments that provide an excellent way to meet other Saitozens while learning some of the more complicated and fun strategy games available.

We also have a few community chats on off-chain platforms where you can drop by to talk shop or ask questions or help us with our ongoing efforts to ban bots and crypto-spam. Join us on these channels anytime:

- [Twitter](https://x.com/SaitoOfficial) - Official Saito Account
- [Telegram](https://t.me/SaitoIO) - Official Saito Discussion Group
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/HjTFh9Tfec) - Official Saito Discord Channel

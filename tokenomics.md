# Tokenomics

The Saito Network has 7bb SAITO tokens. The only way to get tokens is to purchase them from other holders or run a network node that collects payments in exchange for routing fees into the blockchain. All token holders are automatically eligible for payouts from Saito's ATR mechanism, which distributes 25% of on-chain network fees to holders of unspent UTXO at regular intervals.  
  
The easiest way to purchase Saito is through our on-chain store. It is also possible to purchase SAITO tokens at a discount by buying our ERC20 or BSC-wrapped tokens and [migrating your tokens](https://saito.io/migration) to mainnet at any time. Please note that this bridge is the only officially-supported way of migrating off-chain SAITO tokens to mainnet. If someone proactively contacts you and offers to assist it is a scam.

## Purchase SAITO

The most liquid cryptocurrency exchanges supporting the purchase of SAITO ERC20 tokens are:

-   [LCX](https://exchange.lcx.com/en/trade/SAITO-EUR)

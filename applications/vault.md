# Saito Vault

The [Saito Vault](https://saito.io/vault/) is an application that allows users to upload files to a private archive, and specify or create an NFT that needs to be under the control of a use in order to get access.

The Vault is a powerful showcase of what is possible with Smart NFTs on Saito that is not trivial to implement or run on other networks, where smart contracts have to mediate ownership and permissions.

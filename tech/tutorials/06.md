# Tutorial #6 - CSS Injection

This tutorial explains how to build an application that injects CSS into other applications. This can be used for styling applications, but also for whitelabelling applications, such as replacing the Saito Logo with your own logo when rolling out custom/modified applications.

We assume by now that you can create a module directory. We navigate into the `/mods` directory and create a folder with the name `tutorial06`. That directory should contain a file `tutorial06.js` that contains the standard constructor. Note the existence of a CSS file in the 

```js
var ModTemplate = require('../../lib/templates/modtemplate');
const CssInjection = require('./lib/css.template');

const SaitoOverlay = require('./../../lib/saito/ui/saito-overlay/saito-overlay');
const myOverlay = require('./lib/myOverlay.template');

class Tutorial06 extends ModTemplate {

  constructor(app, mod) {

    super(app);

    this.name            = "Tutorial06";
    this.slug            = "tutorial06";
    this.description     = "CSS Injection";
    this.categories      = 'Dev';

    this.injected_yet    = false;

    this.app = app;
    this.mod = mod;
    this.overlay = new SaitoOverlay(app, mod);

    return this;
  }



module.exports = Tutorial06;
```

## Insert CSS on Initialization

```js
  initialize(app) {

    let style = document.createElement('style');
    style.textContent = CssInjection();
    document.head.appendChild(style);

  }
```

<!--Navigate into the `/lib/css.template.js` file to see how we've structured a function that returns the CSS we wish to inject. For the sake of this tutorial all we are doing here is modifying the Saito Header class to enlarge the Saito logo in the top left.

Compile and install this application and navigate to your Red Square or Arcade and you'll notice that the Saito logo that appears on the top-left of the screen will show up larger than usual. If you want your module to also be able to monitor and modify the DOM, try adding a listener on `document.body` on load and modifying content as needed when the site changes.-->

Navigate into the `/lib/css.template.js` file to see how we've structured a function that returns the CSS we wish to inject. For simplicity, the only change is to make green the background of the Saito logo that appears in the header of applications such as Red Square or The Arcade.

Compile and install this application and navigate to your Red Square or Arcade - if everything was done correctly it should appear similarly to the screenshot above. If you want your module to also be able to monitor and modify the DOM, try adding a listener on `document.body` on load and modifying content as needed when the site changes.


## Rendering an Overlay

The following code will render an overlay when the Saito client launches.

```js
initialize(app) {

    // CSS Injection
    let style = document.createElement('style');
    style.textContent = CssInjection();
    document.head.appendChild(style);

    // Application Overlay
    this.overlay.show(MyOverlayTemplate(this.app, this.mod));

  }

```

The final line added to `initialize` uses the overlay file from our module, located at `/lib/myOverlay.template.js`, as an input to `this.overlay.show`. Both of these dependencies were brought in at the top of our `tutorial06.js`:

```js
const SaitoOverlay = require('./../../lib/saito/ui/saito-overlay/saito-overlay');
const myOverlay = require('./lib/myOverlay.template');
```

# Saito Username

The ```saito-username``` class is used to display usernames and user addresses, it handles long and short text very well. For aesthetic improvements, longer texts are shorted with ellipsis, while shorter texts aren't


```saito-username```:

  <div class="saito-username">t4gEMWsDjZ4xeYGn2gCGxFg8ty53rs7UQKUpwfvsBq33</div>

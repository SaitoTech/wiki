<h1>Video Call</h1>
<p>One of the newest apps of Saito, which allows users all over the world to connect using voice and video streaming, in real-time, for free and running on Saito's blockchain. Currently, this app is still in constant development and testing. This app works in a peer-to-peer manner, allowing for the moment to connect 4 users at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the Video Call app is still improving every day, and Saito team members have moved most of the two-person meetings to the Saito Video Call, Three and four-person call tests are ongoing, and are using our experiences to keep improving stability and usability. Two-person calls are currently stable and we are focused on improving automatic reconnection and other features that become critical in group calls. If you are looking for a great way to help, please assist by testing this feature on your mobile devices and report to us if you have any problems.</p>

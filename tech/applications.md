# Saito Applications

![](/apps.png)

## Core Apps

Saito Applications are programs that run directly in your browser. These applications have a built-in wallet and use the Saito network to communicate with peers. See our list of [available programs](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/tree/master/mods) or our [tutorials](/tech/tutorials) on how to develop a module from scratch.

## Games

There is a good amount of games running on the Saito platform now, and more to come that are currently in development, some of them have been made for members of the community. With Saito being an open-source project that is delighted to receive apps from other developers to run them in the network, this is just the tip of the iceberg for what is to come.

## Build Your Own

Those interested in building on Saito should start [here](/tech/building_apps). The SDK used to make the all apps on this page is fully available for anyone to begin using. It has built-in functions to interact with the blockchain, perform basic cryptography, establish peer-to-peer connections and more. Applications are built using Javascript and run in the browser.

Many of the beloved Saito apps like [Beleaguered Castle](/tech/applications/BeleagueredCastle) and even [Red Square](/tech/applications/RedSquare) were built or spurred to life by community members. Any developers seeking assistance or who want to offer feedback can reach the lead developers on [Red Square](https://saito.io/redsquare/), [Saito Community Chat](https://saito.io/chat/), [Saito Community Telegram](https://t.me/SaitoIO) or make an [issue](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/issues) on the Github. The team is thrilled to see what the community builds and values developer feedback.

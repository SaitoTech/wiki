# Token Persistence FAQ

<br>

__How does the bridge work?__
* The bridge is one way. Currently from ERC20 to Native tokens only. 

__How do I request conversion?__
* Converstions can be requested at: saito.io/migration

__What wallets are supported?__
* Native tokens can be stored, sent and received in the [Saito Web Wallet](/software/web-wallet) built into all applications on saito.io

__How many Saito tokens to I need to request conversion?__
* Balances are guranteed by the project on a falling curve listed in the [tomenomics](/tokenomics) documnets.
  (Initially balances under 500,000 SAITO will not be guaranteed on chain. Balances below this threshold will be reaped during a chain reset.)
  
__How do I stake tokens?__
* Staking will be very simple, only requiring that a balance be maintained for one ATR cycle. Tokens will not need to be sent or locked in any particular way.

__How do I backup my Wallet?__
* Wallets can be backed up to a file, stored encrypted on the network or as private keys.
  Details are available in the [Saito Web Wallet](/software/web-wallet) documentation.

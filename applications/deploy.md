# Application Deployment

## Saito-lite-Rust Node

Hosting applications from a Saito-lite-Rust Node entails deploying that node to the public internet. Node operators who provide such services can earn fee rewards from the transactions they route.

- [Instructions](./deploy/saito-lite-rust) on deploying a Saito-lite-Rust Node.

## Standalone App (Dynamic Module)

A standalone application requires no central server in order to run or install. So long as the user has the compiled application file, they can run the application from any Saito-lite-Rust lite-client in the browser.

- [Instructions](/tech/compile/applications) on publishing a dynamically compiled standalone application.

Saito applications which run purely P2P will not be limited in functionality by this method of distribution, and *Dynamic Module Packages* can also be used to modify apps which are served by a Saito-lite-Rust Node.

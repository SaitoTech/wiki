# Join the Community

We encourage newcomers to visit [RedSquare](https://saito.io/redsquare) to find and chat with the Saito community. RedSquare is a peer-to-peer social media site. Not only can you ask questions or learn more about the network, but you can experience a genuine peer-to-peer social experience. You can also engage with community members through the Saito Community Chat app that runs on the [Saito Arcade](https://saito.io/arcade).

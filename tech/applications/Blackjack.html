<h1>Blackjack</h1>
<p><strong>Blackjack</strong> (formerly <strong>Black Jack</strong> and <strong>Vingt-Un</strong>) is a casino banking game.<sup>â€Š</sup>It is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card">decks</a> of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-One_(card_game)">Twenty-One</a>. This family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_game">card games</a> also include the European games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vingt-et-Un">Vingt-et-Un</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontoon_(card_game)">Pontoon</a>, and the Russian game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ochko&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Ochko</a>. Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer.</p>
<h3><strong>Player decisions</strong></h3>
<p>After the initial two cards, the player has up to five options: "hit", "stand", "double down", "split", or "surrender". Each option has a corresponding hand signal.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hit</strong>: Take another card.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Signal</i>: Scrape cards against the table (in handheld games); tap the table with a finger or wave a hand toward the body (in games dealt face-up).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stand</strong>: Take no more cards; also known as "stand pat", "sit", "stick", or "stay".</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Signal</i>: Slide cards under chips (in handheld games); wave hand horizontally (in games dealt face-up).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Double down</strong>: Increase the initial bet by 100% and take exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed next to the original bet. Some games permit the player to increase the bet by amounts smaller than 100%, which is known as "double for less".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#cite_note-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Non-controlling players may or may not double their wager, but they still only take one card.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Signal</i>: Place additional chips beside the original bet outside the betting box and point with one finger.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Split</strong>: Create two hands from a starting hand where both cards are the same value. Each new hand gets another card so that the player has two starting hands. This requires an additional bet on the second hand. The two hands are played out independently, and the wager on each hand is won or lost independently. In the case of cards worth 10 points, some casinos only allow splitting when the cards rank the same. For example, 10-10 could be split, but K-10 could not. Doubling and re-splitting after splitting are often restricted. A 10-valued card and an ace resulting from a split usually isn't considered a blackjack. Hitting split aces is often not allowed. Non-controlling players can opt to put up a second bet or not. If they do not, they only get paid or lose on one of the two post-split hands.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Signal</i>: Place additional chips next to the original bet outside the betting box and point with two fingers spread into a V formation.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Surrender</strong>: Forfeit half the bet and end the hand immediately. This option is only available at some tables in some casinos, and the option is only available as the first decision.</li>
</ul>

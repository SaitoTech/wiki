# Saito Vault

The [Saito Vault](https://saito.io/vault/) is an application that allows users to upload files to a private archive, and receive an NFT in return that provides access to the uploaded file.

The Vault is a powerful showcase of what is possible with Smart NFTs on Saito that is not trivial to implement or run on other networks, where smart contracts have to mediate ownership and permissions.

While the default "Upload File" function creates a single key, it is possible to create more advanced custom-scripts that do things like provide access to any participant who has ever participated in the routing path of the NFT, or to add restrictions requiring off-chain passwords or multi-sig accounts.

Because the [Saito Vault] requires NFTs to operate, it requires SAITO in order to use. Those interested in testing out the application are welcome to use the [Saito Testnet Faucet](https://staging.saito.io/faucet) and then the version of the [Saito Vault](https://staging.saito.io/vault) operating on the test network.

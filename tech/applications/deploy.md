# Application Deployment

## Saito-lite-Rust Node

Hosting applications from a Saito-lite-Rust Node entails deploying that node to the public internet. Node operators who provide such services can earn fee rewards from the transactions they route.

- [Instructions](./deploy/saito-lite-rust) on deploying a Saito-lite-Rust Node.

## Standalone App (Dynamic Module)

A standalone application requires no central server to run or be installed from. So long as the user has the compiled application file, they can run the application from any Saito-lite-Rust lite-client in the browser.

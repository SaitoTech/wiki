# Paths of Glory

![](/img/paths_of_glory.png)

Paths of Glory is a sprawling imulation of the First World War (1914â€“1918) that drops players into the chaos of Europe at its breaking point. Opening with Germanyâ€™s invasion of Belgium in August 1914, the game puts its first player in control of the Central Powers, who must manage hostilities on both their Eastern and Western fronts but has significant resources to target either front. In the face of this stronger Central Axis, the much weaker Entente must scramble to organize a defense before its front lines collapse.

Assuming the Allies can survive the initial onslaught, both players will fin the war grinding into a long, brutal contest of attrition in which both players are forced to manage the full weight of modern warfare: over-extended supply chains, dwindling manpower, unstable alliances, and the ever-present need to strike before the enemy does. Much more than a game of military maneuver â€” victory in Paths of Glory hinges on political timing, resource allocation, and knowing when and where to simply entrench.

What sets Paths of Glory apart from other games is its merging of historical fidelity with tight, card-driven mechanics. A well-timed event can mean the difference between holding the line at Verdun or watching the Eastern Front collapse into the Bolshevik revolution. While the real events of history lurk waiting to play-out, nothing is predetermined and the board belongs to the player most skilled at adapting to fortune and failure.

For players who love historical drama, high-stakes decision-making, and the thrill of mastering a complex battlefield, Paths of Glory is a rewarding experience that deepens with every play.

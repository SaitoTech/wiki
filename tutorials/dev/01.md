# Tutorial #1 - Hello World

Our first application alerts the user when they start-up Saito. It also renders a very simple message to the user when they visit the application in their browser. Our goal in this tutorial is to learn how to build and compile very simple applications.


## Creating Module Directory

Navigate into your `saito/node/mods/`directory and create a folder with the name ```tutorial01```. Within that directory create the file ```tutorial01.js```, and copy the text below into the file:

```js
var ModTemplate = require('../../lib/templates/modtemplate');

class Tutorial01 extends ModTemplate {

  constructor(app) {

    super(app);

    this.name            = "Tutorial01";
    this.slug            = "tutorial01";
    this.description     = "Introductory tutorial for Saito App Development";

    return this;

  }

}

module.exports = Tutorial01;
```

As you can see, Saito modules extend from the ModTemplate class. This parent class provides the default set of functions that trigger whenever specific actions happen, such as when a new block is received or a transaction arrives that may require processing.

This gives your Saito applications some basic functionality and integration out of the box. We'll learn how we can override those functions to suit the needs of your applications.

You can see a full list of all the functions by checking the [class documentation](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito/blob/master/node/lib/templates/modtemplate.js) on Github. Note that we also have more modtemplates for common application types, such as cryptocurrencies and games.


## Initializing and Rendering

In order to get our module to run code on startup we need to override the `initialize(app)` function. A good habit is to pass control to the ModTemplate class by running `super.initialize(app)` before we add our own custom logic. Our own code just checks to see if we are running in a browser and pops up an `alert()` message if so.

```js
  async initialize(app) { 
    super.initialize(app);
    if (app.BROWSER) { alert("Hello World!");  }
  }
```

The second function we are going to override is the ```render(app)``` function. This runs whenever the user wants to view our application in their browser. As you can see, it simply writes a short text message into the BODY of the default application page.

```js
  async render() { 
    super.render();
    if (document.querySelector(body)) {
       document.querySelector(body).innerHTML = "Hello World";  
    }
  }
```

Add these functions to the body of your `Tutorial01` class, **not to the end of the file**. Your file should look like [like this](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito/blob/master/node/mods/tutorial01/tutorial01.js).

## Compiling and Serving

Your application won't be compiled until the compile configuration lists it.

Open the file `/saito/node/config/modules.config.js`. This file contains two lists of modules. The first list is in the `core` section -- it lists the modules that will run on your server. The second is in the `lite` section -- it lists the modules that your server will compile for any lite-clients that connect to it and ask for the default set of applications.

This module has no full-node functionality, so there is no reason to add this module to your `core` list. Add it to the list of modules in the `lite` section that will be compiled and provided to browser lite nodes.

```js
lite: [
    'tutorial01/tutorial01.js',
```

Then navigate to `/saito/node/` and compile the javascript bundle:

```bash
> npm run nuke
```

If this is not your first time compiling the software you can run `npm run compile` instead. If you run into trouble we have more detailed instructions on how to compile applications [right here](/install). Once your application compiles, start Saito by running:

```bash
> npm start
```


## Using Your Application

Start up your local node and navigate to any application. As your browser initializes you will see an alert() message popup regardless of which application you are viewing. This is because the code in `initialize(app)` runs each time the client starts running Saito. Here is what it looks like on the Arcade:

<br />
<img src="/tutorials/01/arcade.png" style="max-width:600px" />

Notice that this alert will appear no matter where you navigate through the Saito website. This is because *all* modules are initialized on load and run simultaneously in the browser or node. Try changing ```app.BROWSER``` in the if-then clause to ```this.browser_active``` and see what happens. Only one application is "active" at a time and that is determined by the ```slug```, i.e. the address. 

Now navigate to `/tutorial01` and observe how our code now triggers the `render()` function which replaces the default html it with its own message as below:

<br />
<img src="/tutorials/01/render.png" style="max-width:600px" />

JavaScript is great at manipulating web content, and it clearly works, but notice the 404 error in the tab title, or the flash of red when you run the tutorial. This is because we did *not* include the module in the `core` list of `modules.config.js`. Any module that wants to exist in the browser with a web address should be included in core and we just need to include a web directory inside our module folder to store any assets (like pictures or audio). `Modtemplate` will make sure that your application at least has a blank html page in its directory, though you can override that by placing an `index.html` file at the same level as your `mod_name.js` file.

## Summary
You should have learned:
- where to put a module directory and module js file
- how to edit ```modules.config.js``` to include your app on the server and/or browser
- how to compile your code
- the difference between ```app.BROWSER``` and ```this.browser_active```
- where the module exists on the web page
- the ```constructor```, ```initialize``` and ```render``` functions of ```modtemplate.js```

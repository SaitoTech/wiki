Two cards, known as hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_card_poker">community cards</a> are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street"). Each player seeks the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands">five card poker hand</a> from any combination of the seven cards; the five community cards and their two hole cards. Players have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betting_in_poker">betting</a> options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal.&nbsp;</p>

Our first application alerts the user when they start-up Saito. Our focus is showing how to write a basic module that runs code when Saito initializes, and renders a very simple webpage to the user. We assume that you have already installed a local copy of Saito and can start the node.


## Creating Module Directory

Navigate into your ```/mods``` directory and create a folder with the name ```tutorial01```. Within that directory create the file ```tutorial01.js```. Copy the text below into this this file.

```
var ModTemplate = require('../../lib/templates/modtemplate');

class Tutorial01 extends ModTemplate {

  constructor(app) {

    super(app);

    this.name            = "Tutorial01";
    this.slug            = "tutorial01";
    this.description     = "Introductory tutorial for Saito App Development";

    return this;

  }

}

module.exports = Tutorial01;
```

As you can see above, all Saito modules extend from the ModTemplate class. This parent class provides the default set of functions that will trigger whenever specific actions happen, such as when a new block is received or a transaction arrives that may require processing. You can see a full list of all the functions by checking the [class documentation](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/blob/master/lib/templates/modtemplate.js) on Github.


Feel welcome to customize the name and description of your module. We typically derive the slug from the module name -- it should be an alphanumeric string with only lowercase letters and numbers (no spaces) suitable for displaying in the browser since this slug will be the *address* of our application.

## Initializing and Rendering

In order to get our module to run code on startup we need to override the default ```initialize(app)``` function from the ModTemplate class. A good habit is to pass control to the parent class to let it initialize by running ```super.initialize(app)```. Then we add anything specific we want our module to initialize. We will cover the ```app``` object later -- it is a reference the main Saito object that lets us call all of the functions in the wallet.

```
  async initialize(app) { 
    super.initialize(app);
    if (app.BROWSER) { alert("Hello World - Initializing Tutorial01!");  }
  }
```

An important difference between Saito and other application platforms is that all modules are always initialized whenever Saito starts, and all modules are always running. This can be a bit counterintuitive to web2 developers who often think that the only application that is running is the one they are building, but this is necessary since your applications always need to be ready to receive messages/instructions on-chain or off-chain.

The second function we are going to override is the ```render(app)``` function. This is run whenever the user. We normally use it to initialize the UI for applications when users want to interact with them by viewing the application in the browser.

```
  async render() { 
    if (document.querySelector(body)) {
       document.querySelector(body).innerHTML = "Hello World";  
       alert("Hello World!");
    }
  }
```

What calls this function? When you load your browser, Saito notices that you are trying to interact with an application located at ```/tutorial01``` and it sees the slug matching this in your module and instructs it to render itself. Even though we can install this application on the server, it is the browser that is rendering the webpage locally.

Where does the default HTML come from? In this case, assuming that the server does not have a module installed that will provide custom HTML file when it receives a request for this application, then the user will be served the default-404 HTML page. This page will contain the Saito javascript payload, which triggers them loading their web-content into that HTML frame.

Add these functions to the body of our tutorial file. We are now ready to install this module and compile it.

## Installing and Compiling Your Application

Open the file ```/config/modules.config.js```. This file contains two lists of modules. The first list is in the ```core``` section -- it lists the modules that will run on your server. The second is in the ```lite``` section -- it lists the modules that you will compile for any lite-clients that connect to your server.

You can build modules that are designed to work ONLY for servers or ONLY for browsers, but most modules are written so that they work on both servers and lite-clients. If you need to disable functionality, you can check the ```app.BROWSER``` variable to see if you are running in a browser or not.

Follow the convention in this configuation file and include your tutorial in both the CORE and LITE sections of this file. Then navigate to ```/saito-lite-rust``` and compile

```
> npm run nuke
```

If this is not your first time compiling the software you can run ```npm run compile``` instead. The difference between ```nuke``` and ```compile``` is that ```nuke``` will purge all of the information. This makes it useful for debugging. If you don't want to purge your whole server or wallet, use ```compile``` instead.

The Saito install script will let. If everything goes well you'll If there are any problems, it means you have a typo or javascript error. Fix the problem and run ```npm run nuke``` again until it works. At that point you can start Saito by running ```npm start``` and test your action in real life.


## Using Your Application

Start up your local node and navigate to any application. As your browser initializes you should get an alert() message popup regardless of which application you are viewing. This is because the code in ```initialize(app)``` runs regardless of which application you are viewing in your browser. Here is what it looks like on the Arcade.

<br />
<img src="/tutorials/01/arcade.png" style="max-width:600px" />

To trigger our code in the ```render()``` function, we need to tell Saito to run the render function in our new module. We do this by pointing our browser to the ```/tutorial01``` application. This will be the address specified by your application slug, as per the screenshot below:

<br />
<img src="/tutorials/01/render.png" style="max-width:600px" />

Technically, what is happening in this case is that because this module is not installed on the server, our application is "re-writing" the 404 page that is displayed on the server after it loads. The ability to over-write this page allows you to develop elaborate UI/UX interfaces even if the remote server does not have the application installed.


## Reference Materials

If you would like to test this application without compiling it yourself, you can find a pre-packaged version available for installation into your browser here. Download the file and drag-and-drop it into your browser. The See here for instructions on compiling your own application into this portable format.

You can find the complete source code associated with this tutorial in the default ```/mods``` directory.  Alternately, you can access all of the files in this tutorial by downloading this [ZIP file](/tutorial01_(2).zip). Or just download this application as a [precompiled Saito module](/) and install it into your wallet.



In our [next tutorial](/tech/tutorial-2-chat) we’ll create an application that can receive transactions in addition to sending them. Before we get to that, there’s something important you may have realized: the Saito AppStore is an application like any other application. Although our tutorial series starts with small applications, there’s no limit to the complexity of the applications that you want to build.

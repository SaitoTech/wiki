<h1>Tutorial 3 - Arcade and Red Square Wallet Management</h1>
<p>Saito wallets or accounts are based and stored on the browser's cache they are currently running, for that so, even in the same device (PC, MAC, mobile), every different browser that opens Saito will have its own wallet, same happens when incognito tabs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many users that are not used to blockchain technology, struggle to understand how this works and why they are the guardians and responsible for their own wallets and keys. Saito's wallets do work as the other crypto wallets (cold, hot, or even hardware), the user will have two keys, the <strong>Public key</strong>, which is one that anyone can see, this key is displayed on chat or in the Red Square posts if there is not a username register yet, and can be used to receive coins in the future. The other is the <strong>Private key</strong>, which should be kept safe, if possible not online, since with this key the wallet can be restored on any browser or device, in case of loss, if the user does not have a backup of the wallet or the private key, no one will be able to help them to restore and gain access back to this wallet/account.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Backup and Restore</h2>
<p>First to reveal and save you private key, click on the eye icon <span class="text-big"><mark class="pen-red">(1)</mark></span> then copy the characters <span class="text-big"><mark class="pen-red">(2)</mark></span> that will show in a text file, or even better on paper. If you click on backup wallet (3), this will download a file to your computer that contains the info to restore your wallet (4)&nbsp;</p>

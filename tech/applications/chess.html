The current form of the game emerged in Spain and the rest of Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga">chaturanga</a>, a similar but much older game of Indian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

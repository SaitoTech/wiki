<h1>Wordblocks</h1>
<p>Wordblocks is a crossword puzzle game, spell out words on the board to earn points. The tiles must form words that, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword">crossword</a> fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns and are included in a standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary">dictionary</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon">lexicon</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game is played by two to four players on a square game board imprinted with a 15Ã—15 grid of cells (individually known as "squares"), each of which accommodates a single letter tile. In official club and tournament games, play is between two players or, occasionally, between two teams, each of which collaborates on a single rack.</p>
<p>The board is marked with "premium" squares, which multiply the number of points awarded: eight dark red "triple-word" squares, 12 orange "double-word" squares, of which one, 8 dark blue "triple-letter" squares, and 20 green "double-letter" squares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, you can play in the Saito arcade on English (two dictionaries), SOWPODS or TWL0 or Spanish.</p>

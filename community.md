# Community Resources

Looking to connect with other Saitozens? One of the easiest ways is to visit [RedSquare](https://saito.io/redsquare) our peer-to-peer social media site. Not only can you ask questions or learn more about the network, but you can experience a genuine peer-to-peer social experience and get a better sense of why we think Saito so important.

Prefer gaming? Another popular way for community members to connect is to visit the [Saito Arcade](https://saito.io/arcade) and especially to participate in the various [game nights](/community/game_nights) and tournaments that the community hosts. Participating in group games is an excellent way to learn some of the more complicated strategy games available.

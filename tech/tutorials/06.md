# Tutorial #6 - CSS Injection

This tutorial explains how to build an application that injects CSS into other applications. This can be used for styling applications, but also for whitelabelling applications, such as replacing the Saito Logo with your own logo when rolling out custom/modified applications.

We assume by now that you can create a module directory. We navigate into the `/mods` directory and create a folder with the name `tutorial06`. That directory should contain a file `tutorial06.js` that contains the standard constructor. Note the existence of a CSS file in the 

```js
var ModTemplate = require('../../lib/templates/modtemplate');
const CssInjection = require('./lib/css.template');


class Tutorial06 extends ModTemplate {

  constructor(app) {

    super(app);

    this.name            = "Tutorial06";
    this.slug            = "tutorial06";
    this.description     = "CSS Injection";
    this.categories      = 'Dev';

    return this;

  }

}

module.exports = Tutorial06;
```

## Insert CSS on Initialization

```js
  initialize(app) {

    let style = document.createElement('style');
    style.textContent = CssInjection();
    document.head.appendChild(style);

  }
```

Navigate into the `/lib/css.template.js` file to see how we've structured a function that returns the CSS we wish to inject. For the sake of this tutorial all we are doing here is modifying the Saito Header class to enlarge the Saito logo in the top left..

Compile and install this application and navigate to your Red Square or Arcade and you'll notice that the Saito logo that appears on the top-left of the screen will show up larger than usual. If you want your module to also be able to monitor and modify the DOM, try adding a listener on `document.body` on load and modifying content as needed when the site changes.

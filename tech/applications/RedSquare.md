# Red Square
  
[Red Square](https://saito.io/redsquare/) is a social media application that runs atop the Saito Network. Users can create posts, leave comments, like or otherwise engage with peer comments.

Unlike Twitter and other "web3" social media platforms like Mastadon and Nostr, RedSquare is genuinely decentralized. Instead of fetching "tweets" and other content from a single server, users request them from the peer nodes to which they are connected across the swarm. Moderation functions are similarly decentralized, so your experience using the site depends heavily on the friends you make online.

This allows RedSquare to achieve what more mainstreain crypto platforms like Mastadon or Nostr fail to provide: a truly uncensorable public square in which all users are treated on equal terms.

Like many Saito applications, Red Square is agnostic to whether the content it processes arrives through on-chain or off-chain protocols. By default all content is broadcast onto the underlying Saito blockchain, but content can also be fetched from off-chain transaction archives. The architecture is designed to scale with the amount of traffic on the underlying blockchain, allowing cost-sensitive users to shift more activity to off-chain peer-to-peer channels as public broadcast grows more expensive.
    
If you are getting started with RedSquare, browse through the content you can see and start *following* users whose content you like. You'll not only get amplified access to their media streams, but you'll allow them to help sculpt the nature of the content you see by default: all fully transparently, and all without adding centralized parties to limit your freedom of action on the web.

## [DeMod](https://saito.tech/saito-modtools-decentralized-moderation/) - Decentralized Moderation

One of the most important problems addressed by RedSquare is the problem of how to handle content moderation in a truly decentralized network without a trusted third-party to limit access. How does RedSquare handle this? We empower you.

If you wish to hide or block a certain user, click on the tweet and select the appropriate response. In the event of illegal or highly-unethical content, we encourage users to *report* the tweets so the Saito Team can ensure we are not amplifying harmful materials by default.

Spam and fraud prevention, curation and moderation consequently flow from the aggregate preferences of the users to whom you are connected. Instead of relying on centralized parties like Elon Musk to limit access by controlling accounts, RedSquare shifts to a permissionless model where spam is controlled by a decentralized swarm of users flagging and blocking it in real-time.

As site traffic grows and trivial fees become necessary to post tweets, the economic requirements are expected to provide an additional sanity-check against the willful spamming of malicious or harmful materials.

**Distributed Whitelists and Blacklists**

Most users of the internet don't want a highly proactive relationship with content - they simply want good curation. Open-source, distributed whitelists and blacklists for content solve for this: users can subscribe to sensible policies determined by those they trust, but are also freely able to edit, opt-out or otherwise customize their experience.

The benefits and conveniences of platforms performing moderation functions can still be enjoyed, but not without the ability for each individual user to perform personal oversight and take matters into their own hands as they see fit. Rather than a company buyout or state pressure being necessary to change moderation policy, users can create and select for what they personally see fit.

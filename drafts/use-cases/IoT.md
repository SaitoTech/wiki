# Use Cases

## draft1: Too Many Chains

A common question for those investigating a new blockchain is: what are the use cases? Money, smart contracts, decentralized finance, trustless computation - use cases are evolving constantly. But the creation of new projects to address each use case is unecessary and fractures the network effects vital to the security of blockchains and distributed ledgers. In reality, each use case taking the unique property of blockchain and applying it to specific utilities.

When this specific property can be identified and objectively measured, it becomes possible to optimize the network for this property and thus results in a network which is best suited to serve *every use case* which can leverage it. That property is *Universal Broadcast.* Much like a farm should concern itself with productivity rather than how its food is used, a blockchain's only genuine role is provide the largest quantity with the lowest fee and highest cost of attack possible.

Universal Broadcast means that anyone paying the market fee is allowed to transmit data into a network which is similarly accessible to anyone, is immutable and is permisionless. Every blockchain targetting a specific use case or not relies on these features else it is not truly an open network.

While a Universal Broadcast network has many use cases, they are not specifically relevant to how the network operates, and can be implemented independently of one another with the blockchain as the base layer. Imposing that all fee-earning nodes, for example, specialize in and perform smart contract computation, forces all users whether they use that specific service or not, to fund the infrastructure which is required to perform it.

Saito thus focuses on three properties: networking, storage and security. With all three of these properties working to reinforce each other, Saito becomes the most scalable and secure blockchain possible.

## draft2: Use Cases

The most common question from those investigating blockchain is: "What are the use cases?" While there certainly exist many chains targetting a wide variety of applications, it is massively unecessary, counter-productive, and dishonest to build a new blockchain for every possible application of it. In reality, blockchain performs a single task: *Universal Broadcast;* every possible use case of blockchain flows from there.

Saito is an open permisionless network for which sustainable and extractive economic attacks like the [51% attack](https://wiki.saito.io/consensus/majoritarian-attacks) are not possible. Saito is also the most scalable blockchain, because it is the only chain where the rewards for the necessary work are directed towards the infrastructure required for the chain to function: networking and storage - meaning that, like business with an economy of scale, the cost for consumers need not rise as demand increases. Transaction cost likely decreases with scale.

By building a blockchain which is thus optimized to provide Universal Broadcast at the cheapest possible fee per byte at any scale, with the strongest security of any permisionless network, that Saito is the best platform for *every* possible use case of blockchain - including those which were previously too expensive to even consider.

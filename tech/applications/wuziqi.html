<h1>Wuziqi</h1>
<p>Wuziqi, also called <i>Five in a Row</i>, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy_game">strategy game</a> played with black and white stones on a Go board. The Saito module was developed to show how easy it is to implement games of this sort. It is implemented on a 15×15 board and comes with the standard set of features available to all Saito modules: integrated text and video chat, on-chain staking, and of course real-time video swarmcasting.</p>

<h4>Game Rules</h4>
<p>Players take turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If placement creates a line of more than five stones that is considered an “overline" and does not result in a win.</p>

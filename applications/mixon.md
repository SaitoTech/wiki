# Mixin

The Saito Mixin module allows the Saito Wallet and all modules running atop it to integrate with the Mixin Network and its family of supported crypto-assets, enabling Saito applications to send and receive third-party crypto tokens directly within Saito. This includes functionality for:

* monitoring Mixin addresses for incoming payments
* sending and verifying token transfers
* eupporting Mixin-based token usage in Saito games and applications

Mixin is a Layer-2 payment network that facilitates instant, zero-fee transfers across a variety of assets and chains. We consider this an important feature for Saito users who wish to use these tokens within Saito applications, as it permits rapid token exchanges.

The module is a pre-requisite for the installation of other modules which add support for specific Mixin-supported cryptocurrencies, like the Saito [Ethereum module](/applications/ethereum). It is very fast and easy to support new cryptocurrencies in the wallet.

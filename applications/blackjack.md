# Blackjack

Blackjack is a classic casino card game in which players compete against the dealer to build a hand whose total value is as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Played with one or more standard decks of 52 cards, the game combines elements of chance and strategy. Players are dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand), with additional options like "double down" or "split" depending on the rules in play.

A hand totaling exactly 21 with the first two cards—a ten-value card and an ace—is called a "blackjack" and usually wins automatically with a bonus payout. The dealer must follow fixed rules, typically hitting until reaching 17 or higher.

On Saito, Blackjack demonstrates how simple, deterministic games can be hosted trustlessly on the blockchain, allowing users to play in a fair environment where game state and outcomes are auditable by all participants.

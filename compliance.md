# Legal Compliance and Content Policies

Saito is a community-driven network, and we care deeply about protecting the freedom of users to speak, publish, and build. At the same time, operating a public network carries legal responsibilities. Our goal is to balance an open environment with the obligations that apply to any service hosting community-submitted material.

In order to comply with applicable laws -- including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other content-related regulations -- we maintain a notice-and-takedown process and a repeat-infringer policy. These rules are not intended to limit expression. They exist to ensure that the network can remain open, interoperable, and safe for all who uses it.

## Notice and Takedown Policy

Saito is a platform generated and maintained by its community. As such, it can host and serve content submitted by community members. In order to balance their rights with those of others, we respect the rights of creators as a network host and comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”).

If you believe material on this site infringes your copyright, please send a takedown notice containing the information listed below. Once we receive a valid notice, we will review it promptly and remove or disable access to content in our local archive as required.

**1. How to Submit a Takedown Notice**

Your written notification must include:

* Identification of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed. If multiple works are involved, provide a representative list.
* Identification of the material you believe infringes your rights, including the exact URL or specific location.
* A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized by you, your agent, or the law.
* A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
* Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
* Your physical or electronic signature.

Send notices to our designated copyright agent:

**Saito Technologies (Angiers PTE LTD)**
**Room 1101, 11/F, 299QRC**
**Central, Hong Kong**

**2. Counter-Notification Procedure**

If your content was removed as a result of a takedown notice and you believe the removal was mistaken or that you are legally permitted to use the material, you may send us a counter-notification. Your counter-notification must include:

* Identification of the content that was removed and the location where it appeared.
* A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief the material was removed as a result of mistake or misidentification.
* Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
* A statement consenting to the jurisdiction of the federal court in your district (or, if outside the United States, the district where our service is located) and agreeing to accept service of process from the original complainant.
* Your physical or electronic signature.

If we receive a valid counter-notification, we may restore the material unless the original complainant informs us within fourteen (14) days that they have filed a legal action seeking to restrain the use of the material.

3. Repeat Infringer Policy

In accordance with the DMCA, we will terminate accounts of users who are found to be repeat infringers. We reserve the right to decide what counts as a repeat infringement based on the circumstances of each case.

4. Good-Faith Moderation

We may remove content at our discretion if it appears to infringe rights or violates other community or legal standards, even outside the formal DMCA process.

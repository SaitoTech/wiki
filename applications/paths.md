# Paths of Glory

![](/img/paths_of_glory.png)

Paths of Glory is a sprawling recreation of the Great War (1914-1918) that throws its players into the heart the first world war. Opening with Germany's invasion of Belgium in August 1914, Paths of Glory puts its first player in control of the Central Powers, who must manage hostilites on both their Eastern and Western fronts. In the face of their dominant military aggression, the weaker Entene must race to amass its defense before the front collapses.

If the Allies can avoid a crushing defeat at the start, the game shifts both players into managing the gruelling logistics of modern warfare: long supply lines, stretched manpower, shifting alliances, and the constant pressure to act before the opponent does. As one of the most seminal strategy games ever made, Paths of Glory offers intricate trade-offs that involve not just maneuvering on the battlefield, but even the choices made behind the lines - where to entrench, where to attack, and how to turn limited resources into lasting advantage.

What sets Paths of Glory apart is its fusion of historical fidelity with tight, card-driven mechanics. A well-timed event or redeployment can mean the difference between holding the line at Verdun or watching the Eastern Front collapse as Russia collapses with the Bolshevik revolution. While the real events of history lurk waiting to play-out, nothing is predetermined and the board belongs to the player who can best adapt to both fortune and failure.

For players who love historical drama, high-stakes decision-making, and the thrill of mastering a complex battlefield, Paths of Glory is a rewarding experience that deepens with every play.

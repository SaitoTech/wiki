# Tutorial #1 - Hello World

### Before You Begin

Be sure you've succesfully installed and can run your local Saito Node before moving forward. You can learn how [here](https://wiki.saito.io/en/tech/installation).

## Intro

- The complete `tutorial01` code can be referenced [here](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/blob/master/mods/tutorial01).

Our first application alerts the user when they start-up Saito. It also renders a very simple message to the user when they visit the application in their browser. Our goal in this tutorial is to learn how to build and compile very simple applications.


## Creating Module Directory

Navigate into your ```saito-lite-rust/mods/``` directory and create a folder with the name ```tutorial01```. Within that directory create the file ```tutorial01.js```, and copy the text below into the file:

```js
var ModTemplate = require('../../lib/templates/modtemplate');

class Tutorial01 extends ModTemplate {

  constructor(app) {

    super(app);

    this.name            = "Tutorial01";
    this.slug            = "tutorial01";
    this.description     = "Introductory tutorial for Saito App Development";

    return this;

  }

}

module.exports = Tutorial01;
```

As you can see, Saito modules extend from the ModTemplate class. This parent class provides the default set of functions that trigger whenever specific actions happen, such as when a new block is received or a transaction arrives that may require processing.

This gives your Saito applications some basic functionality and integration out of the box. We'll learn how we can override those functions to suit the needs of your applications.

You can see a full list of all the functions by checking the [class documentation](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/blob/master/lib/templates/modtemplate.js) on Github.


## Initializing and Rendering

In order to get our module to run code on startup we need to override the `initialize(app)` function.

A good habit is to pass control to the ModTemplate class by running `super.initialize(app)` before we add our own custom logic. Our own code just checks to see if we are running in a browser and pops up an `alert()` message if so.

```js
  async initialize(app) { 
    super.initialize(app);
    if (app.BROWSER) { alert("Hello World!");  }
  }
```

The second function we are going to override is the ```render(app)``` function.

This runs whenever the user wants to view our application in their browser. As you can see, it simply writes a short text message into the BODY of the default application page.

```js
  async render() { 
    super.render();
    if (document.querySelector(body)) {
       document.querySelector(body).innerHTML = "Hello World";  
    }
  }
```

Add these functions to the body of your `Tutorial01` class, **not to the end of the file**. Your file should look like [like this](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/blob/master/mods/tutorial01/tutorial01.js).

## Installing and Compiling

Your application won't be compiled until the compile configuration lists it.

Open the file `/saito-lite-rust/config/modules.config.js`. This file contains two lists of modules. The first list is in the `core` section -- it lists the modules that will run on your server. The second is in the `lite` section -- it lists the modules that your server will compile for any lite-clients that connect to it and ask for the default set of applications.

This module has no full-node functionality, so there is no reason to add this module to your `core` list. Add it to the list of modules in the `lite` section that will be compiled and provided to browser lite nodes.

```js
lite: [
    'tutorial01/tutorial01.js',
```

Then navigate to `/saito-lite-rust` and compile the javascript bundle:

```bash
> npm run nuke
```

If this is not your first time compiling the software you can run `npm run compile` instead. If you run into trouble we have more detailed instructions on how to compile applications [right here](https://wiki.saito.io/en/tech/installation#configuration). Once your application compiles, start Saito by running:

```bash
> npm start
```


## Using Your Application

Start up your local node and navigate to any application. As your browser initializes you will see an alert() message popup regardless of which application you are viewing. This is because the code in `initialize(app)` runs each time the client starts running Saito. Here is what it looks like on the Arcade:

<br />
<img src="/tutorials/01/arcade.png" style="max-width:600px" />

To trigger our code in the `render()` function, we need to tell Saito to run the render function in our new module. We do this by pointing our browser to the `/tutorial01` application. You'll see that your module is grabbing the default HTML and replacing it with its own message as below:

<br />
<img src="/tutorials/01/render.png" style="max-width:600px" />

## Reference Materials

You can find the complete source code associated with this tutorial in the default `/mods` directory.  Alternately, you can access all of the files in this tutorial by downloading this [ZIP file](/tutorial01_(2).zip). Or just download this application as a [precompiled Saito module](/) and install it into your wallet.

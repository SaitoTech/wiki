<h1>Quake 3</h1>
<p>Quake3 is a multiplayer first-person shooter originally released by ID Software in 1999. This version runs directly in your browser and connects with Saito to use other Saito applications and bring modules right into the game.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessors, <i>Quake III Arena</i> does not have a plot-based single-player campaign. Instead, it simulates the multiplayer experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_game_bot">computer-controlled players</a> known as bots. The game's story is brief: "the greatest warriors of all time fight for the amusement of a race called the Vadrigar in the Arena Eternal." The introduction video shows the abduction of such a warrior, Sarge, while making a last stand. Continuity with prior games in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(series)"><i>Quake</i> series</a> and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)"><i>Doom</i></a> is maintained by the inclusion of player models and biographical information. A familiar mixture of gothic and technological map architecture as well as specific equipment is included, such as the Quad Damage power-up, the rocket launcher, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFG10K">BFG</a>.</p>
<p>In <i>Quake III Arena</i>, the player progresses through tiers of maps, combating different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_game_bot">bot</a> characters that increase in difficulty, from Crash (at Tier 0) to Xaero (at Tier 7). As the game progresses, the fights take place in more complex arenas and against tougher opponents.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena#cite_note-grev-6"><sup>[3]</sup></a> While deathmatch maps are designed for up to 16 players, tournament maps are designed for duels between 2 players and in the single-player game could be considered 'boss battles'.</p>
<p>The weapons are balanced by role, with each weapon having advantages in certain situations, such as the railgun at long-range and the lightning gun at close quarters. The BFG super-weapon is an exception to this; compared to other similarly named weapons in the <i>Doom</i>/<i>Quake</i> series, <i>Quake III Arena'</i>s incarnation of this weapon is basically a fast-firing rocket launcher and it is found in hard-to-reach locations. Weapons appear as level items, spawning at regular intervals in set locations on the map. If a player dies, all of their weapons are lost and they receive the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawning_(computer_gaming)">spawn</a> weapons for the current map, usually the gauntlet and machine gun. Players also drop the weapon they were using when killed, which other players can then pick up.</p>

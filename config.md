# Saito Configuration

Once you have [installed Saito](/install) you have a basic Saito node with a default set of minimal applications that we think you will want to run by default. You will probably want to customize both that set of modules, as well as configure how your node connects to the network.

This page provides a quick overview of where the configuration files are that you should know about as a developer, as well as links to pages that contain detailed instructions on configuration options.

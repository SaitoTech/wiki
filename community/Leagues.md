# Saito Leagues

The Saito Leagues are community-run recurring events that take place in the Saito Arcade.

Participants can join at any time. Players are assigned weekly matches but they can also choose to reach out to other participants to play matches and accumulate points. At the end of each season, the players with the most points qualify for the playoffs and play each other, tournament style.

Currently, there are 3 Leagues taking place:

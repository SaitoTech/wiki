# Library

<br />
<img src="/img/library.png" />

The Saito Library allows users to maintain "collections" of abstract classes of content which can be leant-out to friends, with the module enforcing the traditional library function of ensuring that only one user has the ability to use material at any time.

The Library contains basic functionality allowing people to broadcast what kinds of content they have available, as well as manage the terms on which the content is available for transfer and use between participants in the network. It is designed to protect the rights of publishers under traditional copyright law without the need for a publisher-managed system that is inherently biased against supporting and enforcing legitimate consumer rights to resell and trade purchased content.

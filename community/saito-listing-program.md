# Saito Listing Program

The Saito Listing Program exists to help cryptocurrency developers get their tokens working on the Saito Network and integrated with the official Saito nodes. Benefits of listing include:

* simple token transfers through the Saito Wallet
* integration with RedSquare and Saito Arcade
* automatic integration into all new token features

## Get Listed on Saito

A big factor we are looking for when choosing a crypto is community support. We want to give a Web 3 home to communities that will find genuine utility in the P2P Saito Network. We believe true cypherpunks will find great value migrating their communities off of Web 2 platforms like Telegram and Twitter and onto Web 3.

### Get Started

To get started listing your favorite crypto on Saito hop onto [Red Square](saito.io/redsquare) and make a post titled "Saito Listing Proposal." Include the following details:

- Token name, ticker and logo
- Token network (if token exists on another network)
- Community Links
- Explanation for why your token should be chosen

Even if a token has already been proposed, feel free to apply again - just be sure to avoid being filtered for spam - be creative and bring grassroots support.

### Bring the Community!

Get your community onto [Red Square](saito.io/redsquare) to show support! One of the big factors we're looking for are communities that can put the most use to the Saito P2P Network. Getting those communities onto [Red Square](saito.io/redsquare) and raiding your proposal is a great way to show that. We welcome the hoards!

### Develop Support Independently

Saito is a permissionless network, and anyone at any time can develop for and support any crypto or feature on their Saito node. If you're a developer interested in that, please reachout to the team on [Red Square](saito.io/redsquare) or [Telegram](https://t.me/SaitoIO).

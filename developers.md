## Developers

Saito development feels different from other blockchains. Instead of pushing transactions to smart-contracts, you write applications that run inside user wallets. Users choose whether or not they want to run them.

This page is a brief attempt to explain why Saito applications are different from other blockchain applications. If you are looking for technical help you may want one of these pages:

- **Install Your Node** → *[Node Setup](#)*  
- **Configure Your Node** → *[Node Setup](#)*  
- **Build an Application** → *[Developer Guide](#)*  
- **Walk Through Examples** → *[Tutorials](#)*  


Saito applications run directly on top of the blockchain and are written in ordinary JavaScript. There are no compilers, no special contract languages, and no permissioned APIs. The easiest way to write an application is actually to put it inside an NFT and let users send it around the network.

Because of this, you do not *need* to run a node to run applications on the network. You need to run a node to develop most applications, and it is useful for helping users install your application. But it is also possible to develop and deploy apps without needing to run public infrastructure.

If you enjoy building things without friction—or if you’ve ever felt constrained by the limits of contract-based chains—Saito is a refreshing platform to develop on.

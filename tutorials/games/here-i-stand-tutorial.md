# *Here I Stand* Game Tutorial

Here I Stand is a simulation of the Protestant Reformation for between 3 and 6 players. When you join the game you'll be automatically assigned control of one or more of the six major powers:

<br>
<div class="factionBox" style="background-color: #019d4c;"></div> Ottomans

<div class="factionBox" style="background-color: #fce75a;margin-left:1rem;"></div> Hapsburgs

<div  class="factionBox" style="background-color: #e54640;margin-left:1rem;"></div> England

<div  class="factionBox" style="background-color: #0090cf;margin-left:1rem;"></div> France

<div  class="factionBox" style="background-color: #7b4d96;margin-left:1rem;"></div> Papacy

<div  class="factionBox" style="background-color: #a2583d;margin-left:1rem;"></div> Protestants

Each faction starts the game with a different number of **Victory Points** (VP). And each has different goals. The Protestants struggle to convert more towns to the Protestant cause. The Papacy needs to contain Protestant expansion and extend Papal control over Italy. Other powers get points by a combination of military conquest (conquering the square keys on the board) and achieving faction-specific goals (piracy for the Turks, chateaux-building for France, and the establishment of a clear line of succession for Henry VIII and the British throne).

## Getting Started

If you are totally new to Here I Stand, one of the easiest ways to learn the game is to play the 2-Player variant, which is also supported by the Saito Module. In this version the major players are the Papacy and the Protestants. This game serves as a tutorial for the larger game and introduces the basic game dynamics.

At the start of each round, you will be dealt a number of cards. Controlling more spaces will slowly increase the number of cards you are dealt each turn. The events on red (*mandatory*) cards will happen whenever you play those cards. Otherwise, you have the choice of playing cards for the event described on it, or for the OPs shown in the top-left hand corner of the card.

OPs may be spent in a variety of ways to advance your interests. The major options for your faction are:

### Protestants

Your default move should be spending OPs to "publish treatises" in Germany. This will teach you the basic rules of religious conversion. You may be periodically pulled into theological debates by the Papacy, which you can navigate. If you wish to host debates, you can spend 3 OPs to do so as well.

If you can find the OPs to allocate to translating the bible into different languages that is an excellent strategy as well. Once you translate the New Testament you will get six reformation attempts. Translating the full bible into a language earns six more reformation attempts with bonus die modifiers. You'll get the hang of this very quickly.

The most complicated part of strategy for the Protestants is managing the "bonuses" offered by your various debators (who the Papacy will be attempting to burn for heresy). The game engine will ask if you would like to use a debater's bonus. Be aware that "committing" your debater in this fashion slightly weakens them in the event they are pulled into a theological debate. Part of your challenge is to balance the benefits you get from committing your weaker debaters to the risks of exposing them to some of the more ruthless Papal inquisitors.

### Papacy

The Papacy will struggle to contain the Protestants during the early part of the game, but will gain strength once the Protestants establish the Schmalkaldic League. It is consequently the harder faction to master in the 2-player game, as it requires both military as well as religious conflict. Military efforts should take precedence in the early game.

If you aren't sure of your strategic options, consider building or "deploying" regulars or mercenaries to Ravenna, and marching them through Modena to conquer the strategically important key of Florence. Once you move troops into Florence you will place the city under siege and have the option to "assault" it the following turn -- if successful this will result in Papal control over the key and earn you both VP as well as a card bonus in subsequent turns for as long as you control the space.

As the game advances, you may find yourself with the option to ally with Venice or Genoa. You can spend OPs to "burn books" (launching counter-reformation attempts to convert spaces back to Catholicism) or hold debates which can not only flip spaces, but remove Protestant debaters (and their strategic bonuses) from the game for good. 


### Overarching Strategy

The Protestants will usually be able to expand their control over Germany throughout the early game. But by the middle of the game the Papacy is better positioned to not only fight back in England and France, but more generally as their military alliance with the Hapsburg lets them conduct military operations in Germany proper. Should the game remain undecided until this point in the Reformation, the Protestant players will also be dragged into military as well as religious conflict, and both players must balance their strategic interest in religious conversion with a geopolitical interest in controlling the keys that give them the cards necessary to keep fighting.

Saito is an indirect mechanism: it implements incentives through signals generated by costly but observable behavior rather than through costless type reports. Because these action-generated signals cannot be reduced to cheap type messages without altering incentives, the direct-revelation reduction required by the Revelation Principle does not hold. As a result, classical impossibility results that depend on this reduction are not binding for routing-work mechanisms.

Given the importance of the distinction between direct and indirect mechanisms, this page reviews the historical development of implementation theory—from Hurwicz’s original formulation of mechanisms as general communication systems to the later shift toward direct revelation in Maskin and Myerson. Our goal is to show that Saito’s design aligns with standard implementation theory, even though the classical impossibility results built on direct mechanisms do not apply to routing-work systems.

## 1. Leonid Hurwicz and the Origins of Mechanism Design

Hurwicz’s foundational insight was that a mechanism is not merely an outcome rule but a *communication system*. The designer specifies a message space and an outcome function, and agents interact with the mechanism by sending signals drawn from this space. Crucially, Hurwicz imposed almost no restrictions on the nature of these signals. They might be direct reports of private preferences, but they could also be signals generated by behavior that leaves verifiable traces in the environment.

As the field developed, practitioners began informally distinguishing between two kinds of mechanisms. *Direct mechanisms* are those in which agents communicate only by reporting their private types, while *indirect mechanisms* were those which allowed agents to take actions that generated observable information the mechanism could observe and use. Hurwicz’s framework makes clear that both forms are legitimate.

In much of the later literature, however, this distinction became obscured as the field restricted attention to the special case of direct mechanisms that accept only costless type reports. Within this restricted environment, Maskin and Myerson showed that many indirect mechanisms can be represented -- *in equilibrium* -- by equivalent direct mechanisms in which agents truthfully report their types. The process of reducing indirect mechanisms to equivalent direct mechanisms became formalized as the Revelation Principle, which provided a powerful tool for studying implementability as any impossibility proven for the direct mechanism automatically applied to any indirect mechanism that could be reduced to it.

The convenience of this reduction came at a cost: it narrowed the mechanism space considerably. The consequence of this narrowing is that the many mechanisms -- including Saito -- cannot be converted into direct mechanisms and therefore lie outside the domain of the impossibility proofs built on Maskin and Myerson's work.


## 2. The Limits of the Revelation Principle

The Revelation Principle applies only under strict assumptions: that agents communicate solely through costless messages, that deviations are represented as alternative type reports, and that all strategically relevant behavior can be encoded in reports from agents to the mechanism. When these assumptions hold, any allocation rule implementable by an indirect mechanism has a direct-revelation counterpart in which truthful reporting is an equilibrium.

But routing-work mechanisms like Saito violate these assumptions.

The first point of failure concerns the inability of the Revelation Principle to handle mechanisms where different types of verifiable actions are costly to those who perform them. When nodes share or hoard transactions or create "fake" transactions that consume blockspace, these behaviors cannot be “announced” through cheap talk reports without changing the actual incentive structure that affects what agents want to report. And the Revelation Principle cannot be applied if shifting to costless reporting changes the practical incentives of agents within the mechanism.

The second point of failure concerns deviations. In a direct mechanism, all deviations are modeled as alternative messages about private type. But in routing work, the very costliness of certain actions can result in deviatinos which would otherwise seem quite practical dominated by other actions or reports. As a result, the space of deviations assumed in direct-revelation frameworks does not match the deviation space in routing mechanisms, and the reduction breaks.

A third point of failure arises from the richness of the underlying informational environment. Because routing work mechanisms implicitly solve a multi-good combinatorial allocation problem: participants have preferences over blockspace, speed-of-inclusion, and other forms of utility such as collusion goods. Any theoretical reduction to a direct mechanism would require agents to report their valuations over an exponentially large highly-dimensional space. Beyond being impractical, this kills our ability to use the Revelation Principle, as the non-quasilinear preferences agents have for many goods force a requirement for agents to share full preference maps under Maskin, and this translates directly into a requirement for all agents to reveal an infinite number of preferences given the infinitely granular nature of the time-preference that motivates action within the mechanism.

Taken together, these three problems show that routing-work mechanisms lie outside the domain in which the Revelation Principle applies. The assumptions necessary for direct-revelation reduction do not hold, and any attempt to force such a reduction would change the strategic environment rather than preserve it. 

## 3. Impossibility Results

Once the Revelation Principle fails, a large number of impossibility results that assume the viability of direct-revelation reduction no longer apply. While we avoid detailed discussions of individual papers here, all of the following traditional results require use of the Revelation Principle and are non-binding on routing work mechanisms:

- **Myerson–Satterthwaite (1983): Bilateral Trade Impossibility**  
  The result depends on direct revelation and quasilinear utilities, both of which fail in routing-work environments.

- **Green–Laffont (1979): Public-Goods Impossibility**  
  Assumes costless misreports and prohibits the use of behavior-generated signals, which routing work relies on.

- **Gibbard–Satterthwaite (1973): Strategy-Proofness for Ordinal Social Choice**  
  Applies only to mechanisms that take ordinal rankings as cheap-talk input; routing work does not operate on ordinal input at all.

- **Bracha–Toueg (1985) and Dwork–Lynch–Stockmeyer (1988)**  
  Byzantine impossibility results that assume message-only communication and prohibit the use of action-generated incentives.

Each of these papers is discussed more thoroughly elsewhere in the Wiki.

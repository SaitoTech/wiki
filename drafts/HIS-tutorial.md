# *Here I Stand* Game Tutorial

Here I Stand is a simulation of the Protestant Reformation for between 3 and 6 players. When you join the game you'll be automatically assigned control of one or more of the six major powers:

<br>
<div class="factionBox" style="background-color: #019d4c;"></div> Ottomans

<div class="factionBox" style="background-color: #fce75a;margin-left:1rem;"></div> Hapsburgs

<div  class="factionBox" style="background-color: #e54640;margin-left:1rem;"></div> England

<div  class="factionBox" style="background-color: #0090cf;margin-left:1rem;"></div> France

<div  class="factionBox" style="background-color: #7b4d96;margin-left:1rem;"></div> Papacy

<div  class="factionBox" style="background-color: #a2583d;margin-left:1rem;"></div> Protestants

Each faction starts the game with a different number of **Victory Points** (VP). And each has different goals. The Protestants struggle to convert more towns to the Protestant cause. The Papacy needs to contain Protestant expansion and extend Papal control over Italy. Other powers get points by a combination of military conquest (conquering the square keys on the board) and achieving faction-specific goals (piracy for the Turks, chateaux-building for France, and the establishment of a clear line of succession for Henry VIII and the British throne).

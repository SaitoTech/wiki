# Community Resources

The easiest way to get involved is using our on-chain social media application [RedSquare](https://saito.io/redsquare). Most of our developers use the site and post regular updates there, so it is the best way to interact directly with people working on the tech.

Visitors are also welcome to drop by any of our off-chain communities to talk shop or ask questions. We tend to spend less time monitoring these channels but read and respond regularly:

- [Twitter](https://x.com/SaitoOfficial) - Official Saito Account
- [Telegram](https://t.me/SaitoIO) - Official Saito Discussion Group
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/HjTFh9Tfec) - Official Saito Discord Channel

### Ways to Help ###

Our biggest challenge is educating people about the nature of the economic problems that Saito solves and why these are solvable despite the insistence of many in the space to the otherwise. The best way to help with these is to educate yourself on Saito fundamentals and engage with others -- if you have any questions reach out to the team anytime.

For anyone interested in more technical problems, we have a list of [harder tasks](/community/tasks) that will take time and effort to unpack. Work on these problems will likely require a background in economics, cryptography or computer science, but should prove interesting for anyone looking to tackle a difficult problem.

A less abstract way to participate is visit the [Saito Arcade](https://saito.io/arcade). Although the Arcade is technically running 24/7 and games are posted fairly regularly, we have various game nights and tournaments that provide ways to meet other players and learn some of the more complicated and fun multiplayer strategy games on the Arcade.

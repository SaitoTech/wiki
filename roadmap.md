# History and Roadmap

Saito Consensus was invented in the Spring of 2017. Early development focused on assembling a javascript prototype to confirm that the mechanism could be technically implemented. Work building the network began in earnest in 2018, with an initial token sale following in 2021 to raise funding for further development.

The network is currently in a reasonably complete technical state, with a user-facing javascript client, a scalable full-node coded in the Rust programming language, and a suite of useful applications that leverage distributed encryption algorithms to power everything from games to social media and communication apps.

Saito has a nucleus of real usage with a community involved in playing games, using the RedSquare social media platform and communicating with each other using our network's suite of open source PKI applications.

With token persistence a reality and ATR payouts scaling with total network fee-throughput, core development is now focused on advanced features like NFT support, a simplified scripting language for multi-sig support and payment and archive node authentication and other benefits that build on the core network. We expect updates and software patches to be applied to the rotating blockchain as is routinely done in other networks through hard forks.

We welcome developers to participate in building the world's first scalable routing-work blockchain! If you have questions or would like to know how to help, please join us on [RedSquare](https://saito.io/redsquare) anytime!

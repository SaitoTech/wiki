# Community Resources

This page contains links to our many official and unofficial chat groups, as well as community-run websites and resources. If you know of anything that should be on this page submit an edit via our [Saito Wiki Github Repository](https://github.com/saitotech/wiki) or email us at community@saito.tech. To those who are new to github, we have created a [step-by-step guide](/community/how-to-contribute-in-wiki) in submitting and getting your request approved.

**TRANSLATIONS:**

Members of our community have done incredible work translating the Saito whitepaper into other languages. Volunteers are also running chat groups where non-native speakers can learn how Saito works in their own language.

While we cannot take responsibility for the content in community-generated documents and chat groups, this is critical work for our success and we’re grateful to everyone who is helping with this mission. We hope that the following resources are useful to non-native speakers. If you are a native speaker in an underserved community and want to help out with this kind of work, please reach out.

**HOW TO HELP WITH CODING AND MECHANISM DESIGN:**

We maintain a list of active [community-led projects](/community/projects) that welcome help - get in touch and we can send work your way. We also maintain a list of more [independent and often difficult tasks](/community/tasks) that often involve dealing with cryptographic or network fundaments. We also welcome [technical proposals](/consensus/proposals) on how to improve Saito Consensus and/or aspects of our technical implementation of it.

# Fileshare

Saito fileshare is a P2P and encrypted file streaming service between two peers. Once a shared secret is established, and a connection made, two users can send as much data as their  bandwidth will allow.

Fileshare exists as a feature within [Saito Chat](https://saito.io/chat/), but can be integrated as a utility for any Saito Application. Developers are welcome to use and modify [the code](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/tree/master/mods/fileshare).

## How To

1. Open [Saito Chat](https://saito.io/chat/).
2. FInd your *Chat ID* URL.

Open the chat menu:
<img src="/chat-id.png" style="padding:10px" />
Copy your *Chat ID* URL by pressing this button near the bottom.
<img src="/my-chat-id.png" style="width: 600px; padding:10px" />

3. Recipient opens the URL.

4. Sender press the *Fileshare Button* 

<img src="/chat-file.png" style="width: 600px; padding:10px" />

That's it. Once the sender chooses a file, and the recipient accepts, it will be privately sent across the P2P connection, no strings attached.

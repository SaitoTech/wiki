<h1>Red Imperium</h1>
<p>Red Imperium is an open source space-civilization game that uses the base mechanics from the utterly-epic 16-hour boardgame Twilight Imperium. As fans of the original game and its brilliant design, our goal with Red Imperium has been to put something that can help teach newbies how to play, let us practice game strategies and faction rollout, and also just have a fun digital way to get a quick fix between our marathon in-person games. Having a computer automate movement and combat speeds things up to the point the experience is also quite different: a full game can be completed in 2-3 hours and played casually over the course of the day.</p>

<h2>Red Imperium Introductory League</h2>
<p>Last but not least is the <a href="https://wiki.saito.io/en/community/Leagues">Red Imperium Introductory League</a>. In contrast to the other leagues, this Introductory League takes a much more casual approach since its goal is to introduce new players to Red Imperium, a fascinating strategy game of galactic conquest.</p>
<p>It is structured much like the Poker Nights and the Chess Club and takes place twice a week on a rotating schedule, this will be sent by email after you register for the league</p>

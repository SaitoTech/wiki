# How to deposit Eth to a Saito Wallet

Saito.io node supports feeless Eth transfers within its node network. Before sending Eth, be sure you are using a Saito.io node or that the node you are using has the same support.

You can be sure that any time the domain begins with https://Saito.io, that feeless inter-network Eth transfers are supported.

Getting Eth into your Saito Wallet is just like getting Eth into other standard self-custodial crypto wallets.

1. First open the hamburger menu from the top right.
2. Next switch your currency from ‘Saito’ to ‘Eth’
3. Optional: [backup](link to backup tutorial) your wallet!’
4. Send Eth to your Saito Wallet Ethereum address

If you followed the steps, you should see your Eth balance in the Saito Wallet as soon as it is confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain. Once the Eth is deposited into your Saito Wallet, all Eth transfers within Saito Network are free and fast!

This makes paying your friends or wagering Eth in games simple - we hope you enjoy the experience. Don’t forget to securely backup your Saito wallet, which will save your private keys as well as your contacts and other important data.

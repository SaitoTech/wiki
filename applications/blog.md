The Saito Blog module provides a way to write and publish blog posts across the Saito Network. Blog posts are published in transactions that are shared with peers either on-chain or saved in private Archive nodes and distributed peer-to-peer to connecting friends.

When viewers attempt to read a blog post, their local browser client sends a request for the related blog post to their peers in the network, which returns the blog-transaction to their browser, validates it, and displays the blog post. If you wish to ensure that a blog post is always publicly visible, you should publish it on-chain so that it is available to most of the archive nodes servicing users across the network.

This module is under active development, and is primarily used right now for the publication of network development updates and more.

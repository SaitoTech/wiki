# Tutorial #2 - Sending Transactions and UI Components

## Intro

- The complete `tutorial02` code can be referenced [here](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/tree/master/mods/tutorial02).

This tutorial explains how to build an application that listens for chat messages and parses them when they arrive. When it receives a chat message with a special message inside, it sends its own transaction out onto the network to celebrate.

This covers sending and receiving transactions, *UI components* and the `/lib` sub-directory of your module.

## Creating Module Directory

Navigate into your `/mods` directory and create a folder with the name `tutorial02`. Within that directory create the file `tutorial02.js`.

Copy the text below into this this file:

```js
var ModTemplate = require('../../lib/templates/modtemplate');
const MainUI = require('./lib/main');

class Tutorial02 extends ModTemplate {

  constructor(app) {

    super(app);

    this.name            = "Tutorial02";
    this.slug            = "tutorial02";
    this.description     = "Transactions and UI Components";

    this.ui              = new MainUI(this.app, this);

    return this;

  }

}

module.exports = Tutorial02;
```

## Module-Level Functions

### UI Components & Rendering

Notice above the addition of a *UI component* named `MainUI` on line 2, which pulls code from the `./lib/main`.

Saito modules can include a `/lib` directory which contains subclasses and template files, which is where our *UI component* will be created later in this tutorial.

In our constructor, we assign `this.ui` to the `MainUI` component (line 14). We then update the default `render()` function (by including the following modified `render()` definition in our `Tutorial02` class) to make this *UI component* to render itself to the screen:

```js
  async render() {
    this.ui.render();
  }
```

### Sending Transactions

The second function we will add is responsible for sending a transaction, and is a useful reference for the data structure of transactions and the steps required to form and propogate them.

See below for a breakdown of what's going on here.
```js
  async sendTutorial02Transaction() {

    let newtx = await this.app.wallet.createUnsignedTransaction();
    newtx.msg = {
      module: this.name,
      data: {
        random : Math.random()
      }
    };
    await newtx.sign();

    this.app.network.propagateTransaction(newtx);

  }
```

### Creating Transactions
```js
this.app.wallet.createUnsignedTransaction()
```
We use the function `createUnsignedTransaction()` from `app.wallet` to create and return a transaction.

This function is normally provided with the address to which you want to send the transaction, and can optionally be provided with fee information. Since none of this information is being provided it defaults to creating a transaction that is addressed to the sender. 

### Modifying Transaction Data

```js
newtx.msg = {
    module: this.name,
    data: {
      random : Math.random()
    }
  };
```

We then fill out the `msg` field to contain the information we want to include in the transaction. You can provide whatever information you want -- in this case we'll just generate a random number so that we can see our application is updating and sending a unique transaction every time it is asked.

### Signing and Sending Transactions

```js
await newtx.sign();
this.app.network.propagateTransaction(newtx);
```

Finally we sign the transaction before sending it out into the network. `propagateTransaction()` lives on the network object and broadcasts a transaction to any peers that want to receive transactions.

### `app` Object
Note that most of the functions that our module needs live on the `app` object submitted as input to the constructor. `app` contains a number of subclasses (`.wallet`, `.storage`, `.network`, `.blockchain`) containing functions to perform useful Web 3 procedures like broadcasting transactions or returning addresses.

If you are creating a transaction, for instance, you'd want functions that live in the `.wallet` object.

## Creating our UI Component

Recall that our *UI component* was defined via:

```js
const MainUI = require('./lib/main');

```
so the next step is to create a `/lib` directory in our module folder and populate it with a file named `main.js`.

The content of `/lib/main.js` is provided below:

```js
const Tutorial02MainTemplate = require('./main.template');

class Tutorial02Main {

  constructor(app, mod) {

    this.app = app;
    this.mod = mod;
    this.name = "Tutorial02Main";

  }

  render() {

    if (document.querySelector("body")) {
      document.querySelector("body").innerHTML = Tutorial02MainTemplate();
    }

    let btn = document.querySelector('.tutorial02-button');
    if (btn) {
      btn.onclick = (e) => {
        alert("sending a transaction!");
        this.mod.sendTutorial02Transaction();
      }
    }

  }

}

module.exports = Tutorial02Main;
```
### Rendering

UI Components in Saito typically have two functions: a `render(app, mod)` function which writes content to the screen, and an `attachEvents(app, mod)` function for UI logic.

In this situation our module is so simple we only define `render()`.

Note that this `main.js` file relies on one more file: `main.template.js`, which simply defines the HTML which will structure the UI. The contents of `/lib/main.template.js` are:

```js
module.exports = () => {

	return `

	    <div id="tutorial02-main" class="saito-container">

	      <h2>Click to Send Transaction</h2>

	      <input type="button" class="tutorial02-button" value="Click Me!" />

      	    </div>
     
  	`;
};
```

When the ```render()``` function is executed, the module checks for the existence of an HTML document and writes the HTML returned from its template file into the BODY of that document. This includes a button with the class `tutorial02-button` to which it attaches the event.

### UI Logic

Once the button is clicked, the code in our UIComponent executes and we trigger an alert to notify the user. After that, we call the function ```sendTutorial02Transaction()``` in our main module file. This way of doing things allows UI Components to access any functions that exist in their application module, as well as any functions that are provided by the core Saito classes.

## Testing

Recompile your application and visit the `/tutorial02` module in your browser. If you are running a standard local node, you can navigate to it via: [http://localhost:12101/tutorial02](http://localhost:12101/tutorial02).

You will see the button appear and if you click on it you'll get the alert message and your browser will send a transaction into the network.

If you'd like to confirm your transaction was sent, make sure you are running the `explorer` module. Visit to see a list of the latest blocks your machine has produced.

On a standard local node, your block explorer can be found at [http://localhost:12101/explorer](http://localhost:12101/explorer).

You should be able to navigate to the latest block and will be able to find your transaction listed in that block, as per the image above. You should be able to see the data that your module inserted into your transaction has been included and can be viewed on the blockchain.

In our [next tutorial](/tech/tutorials/03), we will modify this application to show how to listen to these transactions and process then when we receive them over the network.

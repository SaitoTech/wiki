<p>Tron support on the Saito Network is available through the installation of this module. As Tron support is handled through the <a href="https://wiki.saito.io/applications/mixin">Mixin module</a>, installation of that module is required as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Users should note that the cryptographic keys needed to transfer TRX on the Saito network are stored in your wallet. This means you should back-up your full wallet after creating a TRX address, to ensure you have a backup of the information needed to recover the account. If you restore a Saito wallet by importing only the private-key associated with your Saito wallet, your browser will not be able to recover these additional keys.</p>

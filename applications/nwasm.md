# Nintendo64 Emulation

<br />
<img src="/img/nwasm.jpg" />

The Saito NWASM module moves a Nintendo64 emulator in the browser, allowing players to play the classic Nintendo64 games they own inside any modern browser. From there games can be saved and loaded and the saved games traded across the network.

By default, the module requires players to upload the ROMs that they legally own. Work is underway to link the NWASM module with the Saito [Library](/applications/library) module, to permit users who have the right to rent or sell their copies to transfer them to other network participants in a way that is legal and protected under US copyright law.

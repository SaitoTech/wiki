## Beleaguered Castle

<br>
<img src="/img/beleaguered.png" />

Beleaguered Castle is a solitaire variant played with a deck of 52 playing cards. It is sometimes described as "Freecell without Cells" because its gameplay is similar to that variant except without the empty spaces to maneuver. Beleaguered Castle is also sometimes called "Laying Siege" or "Sham Battle".

Rules:

Player remove all aces from the deck and places them vertically in the center of the board as depicted in the graphic above. The remainder of the cards are then dealt to the left and right of this center column, forming eight rows of six cards each. This forms a distinctive tableau layout with "wings" stretching away from the central column of aces.

The top card in each row (the exposed card) can be placed on either the suite-appropriate ace (or any card atop it) or for shifting to another row regardless of suite. Once a row becomes empty, it can be filled by any card.

The game is won when all cards have been shifted atop the aces.

Saito is an indirect mechanism: it implements incentives through signals generated by costly but observable behavior rather than through costless type reports. Because these action-generated signals cannot be reduced to cheap type messages without altering incentives, the direct-revelation reduction required by the Revelation Principle does not hold. As a result, classical impossibility results that depend on this reduction are not binding for routing-work mechanisms.

Given the importance of the distinction between direct and indirect mechanisms, this page reviews the historical development of implementation theory—from Hurwicz’s original formulation of mechanisms as general communication systems to the later shift toward direct revelation in Maskin and Myerson. Our goal is to show that Saito’s design aligns with standard implementation theory, even though the classical impossibility results built on direct mechanisms do not apply to routing-work systems.

## 1. Hurwicz, Maskin, and the Origins of Mechanism Design

Hurwicz’s foundational insight was that a mechanism is not merely an outcome rule but a *communication system*. The designer specifies a message space and an outcome function, and agents interact with the mechanism by sending signals drawn from this space. Crucially, Hurwicz imposed almost no restrictions on the nature of these signals. They might be direct reports of private preferences, but they could also be signals generated by behavior that leaves verifiable traces in the environment. What matters is that the designer is free to choose the message space appropriate to the environment.

As the field developed, practitioners began informally distinguishing between two kinds of mechanisms. *Direct mechanisms* are those in which agents communicate only by reporting their private types, while *indirect mechanisms* allow agents to take actions that generate observable information the mechanism can use. Hurwicz’s framework makes clear that both forms are legitimate; the distinction reflects modeling choices rather than limitations of the theory.

In much of the later literature, however, this distinction is obscured because Maskin, Myerson, and others focused on the special case of mechanisms that accept only costless type reports. Within this restricted environment, they showed that many indirect mechanisms can be represented—*in equilibrium*—by equivalent direct mechanisms in which agents truthfully report their types. This equivalence became formalized as the Revelation Principle. It provided a powerful tool for studying implementability, because any impossibility proven for the direct mechanism automatically applied to any indirect mechanism that could be reduced to it.

The convenience of this reduction came at a cost: it narrowed the mechanism space considerably. Mechanisms that rely on behaviorally generated signals, or on the endogenous costs of actions, fall outside the scope of direct revelation. Such mechanisms—including Saito—cannot be converted into direct mechanisms without altering incentives, and therefore lie outside the domain of the impossibility proofs built on direct revelation.


## 2. The Limits of the Revelation Principle

The Revelation Principle applies only under strict assumptions: that agents communicate solely through costless messages, that deviations are represented as alternative type reports, and that all strategically relevant behavior can be encoded in reports from agents to the mechanism. When these assumptions hold, any allocation rule implementable by an indirect mechanism has a direct-revelation counterpart in which truthful reporting is an equilibrium.

Routing-work mechanisms violate each of these assumptions. Sharing, withholding, or injecting transactions changes observable features of the network -- features such as the timing of block production which as credible signals within the mechanism. Because these signals arise from real costs, they cannot be replaced by costless type reports without altering the strategic environment. A direct mechanism that attempts to “simulate” the routing mechanism would not be strategically equivalent to it.

Moreover, in a direct mechanism every deviation must be treated as a misreport. But in Saito Consensus, many deviations cannot be represented as costless messages at all, because producing them requires behavior that would be detected or punished by the environment (network topology). The Revelation Principle cannot reduce indirect mechanisms that depend on costly, behavior-generated signals to cheap-talk direct mechanisms while preserving incentives.

The result is that Saito, which use privately verifiable topological information to adjust the cost of sharing messages, fit squarely within the general Hurwiczian framework but lie outside the direct-revelation framework studied by Maskin and Myerson. The incentive properties of these mechanisms—based on costly action-generated signals—cannot be replicated in cheap-talk models and therefore cannot be captured by the classical impossibility results that rely on direct-revelation reduction.

## 3. Why Routing-Work Mechanisms are Irreducible

As above, the Revelation Principle states that, under certain assumptions, any allocation implemented by an indirect mechanism can be implemented by a direct mechanism in which agents truthfully report their private types. This reduction relies on a very specific model of strategic behavior: messages must be costless, all deviations must be representable as alternative reports, and the mechanism must depend only on what agents say rather than what they do. Routing-work mechanisms violate each of these assumptions in essential ways, which is why they cannot be converted into direct mechanisms without altering their incentive properties.

The first point of failure concerns the nature of the messages. In routing work, the signals that determine strategic outcomes are produced by actions within the mechanism. When nodes share or hoard transactions or create "fake" transactions that consume blockspace, these behaviors cannot be “announced” through cheap talk reports without changing the actual incentives facing other participants. And the Revelation Principle cannot be applied if replacing an action with a costless report changes the actual incentives of agents within the mechanism.

The second point of failure concerns deviations. In a direct mechanism, all deviations are modeled as alternative messages about private type. But in routing work, many deviations cannot be represented as misreports because they require actions that are economically costly. A participant cannot cheaply fabricate a routing path or produce a costless block. The very costliness of these actions can result in strategies which involve them being structurally dominated. As a result, the space of deviations assumed in direct-revelation frameworks does not match the deviation space in routing mechanisms, and the reduction breaks.

A third point of failure arises from the richness of the underlying preference environment. Routing work implicitly implements a multi-good combinatorial allocation problem: participants have preferences over blockspace, speed-of-inclusion, and other forms of utility such as collusion goods. A direct mechanism would require agents to report their valuations over an exponentially large space of bundles. Beyond being impractical, this revelation becomes impossible with Saito, as non-quasilinear preferences combine with an infinitely granular form of time-based utility, to force a requirement for full preference maps under Maskin, and this translates directly into a requirement for all agents to reveal an infinite number of preferences.

Taken together, these points show that routing-work mechanisms lie outside the domain in which the Revelation Principle applies. The assumptions necessary for direct-revelation reduction do not hold, and any attempt to force such a reduction would change the strategic environment rather than preserve it. The classical impossibility results that depend on direct revelation are therefore not binding for routing-work systems, and their conclusions cannot be imported into environments where action-generated signals, costly deviations, and combinatorial preferences play a central role.

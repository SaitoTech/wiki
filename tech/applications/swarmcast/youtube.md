# Swarmcasting on Youtube

You can connect a [Swarmcast](https://wiki.saito.io/tech/applications/swarmcast) with YouTube by providing a YouTube Stream Key. Youtube has its own rather unhelpful instructions on how to . Since these are unclear, we're provided more straightforward directions below.

## 1. Visit Youtube

Go to Youtube.com. Click on the top-right menu and select "Youtube Studio".

## 2. Navigate to "Live Streaming" Feature

Click on the "Create" button at the top-right corner of the page. You want to click on the "Go Live" menu option.

NOTE: if this is your first time setting up a swarmcast, Youtube will ask you to enable live streaming for your account -- it usually takes about 24 hours for Youtube to do this, so you should do this at least a day in advance of your first swarmcast. Otherwise, you will be pulled onto a page that asks you to create your stream ID.


## 3. Create a Stream (and get your Stream Key)

If it is your first time setting up a Youtube Stream, you may see a popup asking you whether you want to start streaming now (using your webcam) or whether you want to schedule a stream for later. Youtube changes where and how this option is presented. If you are given it, you always want to select "schedule later" as this is what gest you the stream key.

Once you have told Youtube you want to run a stream, you'll see this screen which invites you to provide a title and description. You can scroll down for more options, including the category for the stream and whether the broadcast is suitable for children. The title and description you provide here will also be used as the title and description for people re-watching your stream after it ends.

Click NEXT when you are ready to continue. There will two more pages of options you need to provide before you will be given a stream key. You do not need to worry too much about them. Once you have clicked through the final popup you will see the following page:

<br />

Your <b>STREAM KEY</b> is below the preview video towards the bottom of the page. You can click on the copy button to copy it into your clipboard. What you want to do is leave this tab open (or come back and open it again) when you are ready to start your Saito Swarmcast.


## 4. Back to Saito!

Back at the Saito Swarmcast, click on the Youtube button when you are ready to start sending your feed to Youtube. Once you click on the Youtube button Saito will ask you for this <b>STREAM KEY</b>. Once you provide it, everything else is automated -- Saito will connect to Youtube and you will see your swarmcast in the preview window on the Youtube Stream page.

**Make sure you click "Play" on Saito to start recording**. When you click "Stop" it will stop both your Youtube broadcast and your P2P Swarmcast at the same time.

See the [Swarmcast Wiki Page](https://wiki.saito.io/tech/applications/swarmcast) for more info on how to use Swarmcast generally.

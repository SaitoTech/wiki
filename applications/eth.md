# Ethereum

Ethereum support on the Saito Network is available through the installation of this module. As Ethereum support is handled through the [Mixin module](/applications/mixin), installation of that module is required as a prerequisite.

Users should note that the cryptographic keys needed to transfer Ethereum on the Saito network are stored in your wallet. This means you should back-up your full wallet after creating an Ethereum address, to ensure you have a backup of the information needed to recover the account. If you restore a Saito wallet by importing only the private-key associated with your Saito wallet, your browser will not be able to recover these additional keys.

## Saito Swarmcast

A [swarmcast](https://saito.io/swarmcast) is a peer-to-peer audio/video broadcast. It works by creating a "swarm" of listeners who pick up and amplify your broadcast in real-time. This allows for video broadcasts at decent scale without the need for on centralized servers or expensive infrastructure.

In additional to automating, Saito also provides swarmcasts with dedicated "group chats" and basic moderation functions. Try using Saito Swarmcast for your next

# Paths of Glory

![](/img/paths_of_glory.png)

Paths of Glory is a two-player game that plunges players into the cataclysm that was the Great War. Spanning the entire war from its start in August 1914 to its weary end in 1918, the game captures the grinding attrition of the conflict.

From its first turn in August 1914, Paths of Glory throws players into control of either the Central Powers or the Entente, forcing them to command armies, manage supply-chains and resources, and navigating political and military crises on multiple fronts. But Paths of Glory is no simple game of tanks and trenches: success demands on balancing military luck with diplomatic and geopolitical maneuvering across multiple fronts. Every card forces a critical decision between combat, repair, redeployment.

What sets Paths of Glory apart from other games is its fusion of historical fidelity with tight, card-driven gameplay. Each card plays feels significant -- careful play can mean the difference between the Allies holding the line in Verdun or watching the Eastern Front collapse under pressure. Victory requires long-term planning but also a willingness to embrace chance.

For players who love historical drama, challenging decisions, and the thrill of outwitting an opponent across a sprawling battlefield, Paths of Glory offers a rich, rewarding experience that gets more enjoyable with each playthrough.

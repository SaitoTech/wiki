<h1><a href="https://saito.io/redsquare/">Red Square</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://saito.io/redsquare/">Red Square</a> (RS) is an integration of the gaming apps that you can find in the arcade, with Social media in a layout similar to Twitter. The games/invites created in the RS will be the same displayed or played in the arcade, the same as the chat that is shared between them. For the posts and likes, everything is stored in the blockchain, which means that every single one of them is a blockchain transaction. The Red Square has played a fundamental role in the increase of the transaction volume (as the blockchain security) since it was launched and provides a new way for the Saitozen to interact.&nbsp;</p>

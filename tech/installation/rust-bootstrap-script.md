# Documentation for Saito Rust Setup Script

This documentation covers the setup script for configuring a Saito Rust node. The script automates the process of configuring the environment, managing configuration files, installing dependencies, and starting the node.

## Overview
The script performs the following main tasks:

- Configures the Node
- Creates Necessary Directories and Files
- Installs Dependencies
- Starts the node



###  Configuring the Node
This section checks if a config.json file exists. If not, it copies a template configuration file and modifies it to ensure the node is set correctly

### Creating Necessary Directories and Files

Ensures the data/blocks directory exists for blockchain data storage and creates an issuance file from a template if it's missing.

Key Operations:
- Directory creation for blocks.
- Issuance file setup.


### Installing Dependencies

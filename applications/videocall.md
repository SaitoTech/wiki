# Video Call

[Saito Video Call](https://saito.io/videocall/) is a peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted video conferencing tool for everyday use. The software is fully decentralized and does not rely on any central servers. Users enjoy:
1. No software download
2. No account registration requirement
3. No phone or credit card number requirement

Just create the call and share the link with a friend and enjoy the fully featured application. There is no network middleman to constrain bandwidth or features. It's open source, P2P and secured by the Saito Network - giving users full security and control.

All audio and video calls also come with dedicated chat channels, and support standard features like sharing presentations. You can also [Swarmcast](/applications/swarmcast) your video calls to turn private calls into realtime public broadcasts.

Video Call can be accessed directly via the above link or through the slide-in menu that is visible in [Red Square](https://saito.io/redsquare/) and other applications.

## How it Works

Saito Video Call uses WebRTC to negotiate direct P2P connections between clients. The Saito Blockchain and routing network serve as the coordination layer both to authenticate users and to perform peer discovery. Saito naturally provides incentives for nodes to host these STUN/TURN services.

Because the coordination layer and application source code are open source and open-access protocols, users, developers and security auditors can verify, tinker and enjoy the same robust infrastructure. No trusted-middleman, no need to sacrifice money, privacy and sanity.

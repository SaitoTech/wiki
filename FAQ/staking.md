# Staking FAQs

**Note:** Saito staking only applies to native tokens, not the ERC20, BEP20, or other wrapped versions of Saito.

## <div id="staking"> Staking in Saito </div>

Despite not being a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, Saito does have a form of 'staking rewards,' for which all wallets with a native balance of Saito are elligible for. These potential rewards are distributed lottery-style, weighted by balance, during the *Automatic Transaction Rebroadcasting,* ATR, period of a UTXO's lifecycle.

Saito Consensus itself is a non-inflationary mechanism, which means in a fully mature Saito Network, staking rewards will come solely from a portion of user fees in blocks where no Golden Ticket solution exists.

## <div id="bonus"> Temporary Staking Bonus </div>

During the early Saito Network, when user fees are not expected to be great, a portion of [tokens](https://wiki.saito.io/en/tokenomics) will be distributed as a bonus to native balances at a rate of 5% APR.

Since staking rewards require that a transaction be processed by the ATR mechanism, transactions will not be elligible to receive rewards until they are several months old.

## <div id="how"> How to Stake </div>

Staking on Saito requires ownership of native Saito tokens. If you own wrapped Saito tokens and wish to migrate them to the native network, follow closely [these instructions](https://wiki.saito.io/en/tokenomics#migration-to-native-saito-token), and double check you are using the official migration too, and not a scam!

# Saito Documentation

## Saito Modules

Saito modules are the standard way to develop, serve and run P2P applications. [Saito Lite Rust](https://wiki.saito.io/en/tech/javascript) allows users to easily run any P2P app on a browser lite-node and for full nodes to distribute these applications, provide service and earn transaction fees.

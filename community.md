# Community Resources

One of the easiest ways is get involved is to visit [RedSquare](https://saito.io/redsquare) our peer-to-peer social media site. Not only can you ask questions or learn more about the network, but you can experience a genuine peer-to-peer social experience and get a better sense of why distributed PKI apps are the future.

For anyone interested in more academic problems, we have a list of [harder tasks](/community/tasks) that will take time and effort to unpack. Work on these problems will likely require a background in economics, cryptography or computer science, but may be interesting for anyone looking to tackle a difficult problem.

Another way to participate is visit the [Saito Arcade](https://saito.io/arcade). Although the Arcade is technically running 24/7 and games are posted fairly regularly, we have various [game nights](/community/game_nights) and tournaments that provide ways to meet other Saitozens and learn some of the more complicated and fun multiplayer strategy games on the Arcade.

We also have a few community chats on off-chain platforms where you can drop by to talk shop or ask questions or help us with our ongoing efforts to ban bots and crypto-spam. Join us on these channels anytime:

- [Twitter](https://x.com/SaitoOfficial) - Official Saito Account
- [Telegram](https://t.me/SaitoIO) - Official Saito Discussion Group
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/HjTFh9Tfec) - Official Saito Discord Channel

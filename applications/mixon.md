# Midnight Rogue

In this adaptation of a text-adventure game from the British game designer Steve Jackson, you play as an apprentice thief in a notorious Arabian “City of Thieves” who is given one night to steal a priceless gem and gain admission to the Guild of Thieves. Can you find who own the coveted artifact and secure it before sunrise?

This module is a simple tutorial intended to illustrate how to build simple but practical games using the Saito Game engine. It uses the form of a text-adventure to show the flexibility of the engine to non-traditional game forms that can nonetheless be enjoyed in the browser.

## <div id="staking"> How do I stake my Saito?</div>

Saito Consensus diverts 25% of all transaction fees into a consensus-managed treasury that is distributed to unspent UTXO as they loop around the chain. Because this process is handled by consensus, all Saito tokens are automatically "staked" as soon as they are received in your wallet. You can learn more about the [ATR mechanism](/consensus) in our section on Saito Consensus.

The purpose of the ATR payout is to increase the cost-of-attack for attackers. Because attackers must spent their own tokens to attack the network, the ATR payout is an additional way that Saito aggressively redistributes the content of attacker wallets to non-attackers. The existence of a payout to UTXO which are forced to go unspent during attacks also increases the censorship resistance of the network. If you are censored you will be paid for it.

As a result of this design, the only requirement for earning "staking" income in the network is to have tokens looping around the network in an unspent state. Consensus may be modified in the future to require tokens to periodically move to maintain eligibility, but at the present there is no limit on how long tokens can go unspent and still receive ATR payouts.

## <div id="bonus"> What is the APY for Staking? </div>

During the growth stage of the Saito Network, when user-paid fees are not expected to be significant, a portion of the network [token supply](https://wiki.saito.io/en/tokenomics) is reserved for encouraging holders with to migrate token balance on-chain. This reward works out to a bonus of approximately **5% APY** for on-chain balances.

In the future, the size of the ATR payouts will depend solely on transaction fee throughput. There is no ceiling to the amount of fees that the ATR mechanism can redistribute, save the fee-throughput of the network. Those wishing to increase ATR payouts should work to promote Saito and increase the fee-throughput of the network.

## <div id="how"> How to Stake </div>

If you do not have Saito tokens on mainnet you will need to purchase them from an existing holder or purchase them off-chain and migrate them to the network. For help with both see our page on [how to purchase Saito](/tokenomics).

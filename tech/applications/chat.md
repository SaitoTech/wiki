# Chat



![chat-aug-2024.png](/chat-aug-2024.png)



[Saito Chat](https://saito.io/chat/) runs on top of the Saito blockchain and communicates with other clients P2P. This simply means that it runs between **two or more computers, phones, or tablets that can share resources and communicate without going through a central server. Your communication is quick and secure and only involves the blockchain and your intended recipients - no middlemen.

To access to Saito Community Chat, which is a public room where you can freely talk with other users and members of the Saito team, you only need to open the [Chat App](https://saito.io/chat/). You can also find chat at the bottom right of your screen on [Saito Arcade](https://saito.io/arcade/) or [Saito RedSquare](https://saito.io/redsquare/#home). 

## Private Chats

Saito chat one-ups end-to-end encrypted chat applications by leveraging the Saito Blockchain to transmit all data after key exchange purely P2P rather than through any particular centralized provider.

You can also have private chats with anyone that wish using the public key, username, or even by clicking their name on the community chat and then clicking on “Add Contact”, doing this will open another chat window that will be only you and the other user.

# Tutorial #1 - Hello World

Our first application alerts the user when they start-up Saito. It also renders a very simple message to the user when they visit the application in their browser. Our goal in this tutorial is to learn how to build and compile very simple applications.


## Creating Module Directory

Navigate into your ```/mods``` directory and create a folder with the name ```tutorial01```. Within that directory create the file ```tutorial01.js```. Copy the text below into this this file.

```
var ModTemplate = require('../../lib/templates/modtemplate');

class Tutorial01 extends ModTemplate {

  constructor(app) {

    super(app);

    this.name            = "Tutorial01";
    this.slug            = "tutorial01";
    this.description     = "Introductory tutorial for Saito App Development";

    return this;

  }

}

module.exports = Tutorial01;
```

As you can see, Saito modules extend from the ModTemplate class. This parent class provides the default set of functions that trigger whenever specific actions happen, such as when a new block is received or a transaction arrives that may require processing. You can see a full list of all the functions by checking the [class documentation](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/blob/master/lib/templates/modtemplate.js) on Github.


## Initializing and Rendering

In order to get our module to run code on startup we need to override the ```initialize(app)``` function. A good habit is to pass control to the ModTemplate class by running ```super.initialize(app)``` before we add our own custom logic. Our own code just checks to see if we are running in a browser and pops up an alert() message if so.

```
  async initialize(app) { 
    super.initialize(app);
    if (app.BROWSER) { alert("Hello World!");  }
  }
```

The second function we are going to override is the ```render(app)``` function. This runs whenever the user wants to view our application in their browser. As you can see, it simply writes a short text message into the BODY of the default application page.

```
  async render() { 
    super.render();
    if (document.querySelector(body)) {
       document.querySelector(body).innerHTML = "Hello World";  
    }
  }
```

Add these functions to the body of our tutorial file. Your file should look like [like this](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/blob/master/mods/hearts/hearts.js).

## Installing and Compiling

Open the file ```/config/modules.config.js```. This file contains two lists of modules. The first list is in the ```core``` section -- it lists the modules that will run on your server. The second is in the ```lite``` section -- it lists the modules that your server will compile for any lite-clients that connect to it and ask for the default set of applications.

There is no reason to add this module to your server because it won't do anything, but you should add it to the list of modules in the ```lite``` section that will be compiled and provided to browsers. Then navigate to ```/saito-lite-rust``` and compile the javascript bundle:

```
> npm run nuke
```

If this is not your first time compiling the software you can run ```npm run compile``` instead. If you run into trouble we have more detailed instructions on how to compile applications right here. Once your application compiles, start Saito by running ```npm start```,


## Using Your Application

Start up your local node and navigate to any application. As your browser initializes you will see an alert() message popup regardless of which application you are viewing. This is because the code in ```initialize(app)``` runs each time you start running Saito. Here is what it looks like on the Arcade.

To trigger our code in the ```render()``` function, we need to tell Saito to run the render function in our new module. We do this by pointing our browser to the ```/tutorial01``` application. You'll see that your module is grabbing the default HTML and replacing it with its own message as below:

<img src="/tutorials/01/render.png" style="max-width:600px" />



## Reference Materials

If you would like to test this application without compiling it yourself, you can find a pre-packaged version available for installation into your browser here. Download the file and drag-and-drop it into your browser. The See here for instructions on compiling your own application into this portable format.

You can find the complete source code associated with this tutorial in the default ```/mods``` directory.  Alternately, you can access all of the files in this tutorial by downloading this [ZIP file](/tutorial01_(2).zip). Or just download this application as a [precompiled Saito module](/) and install it into your wallet.



In our [next tutorial](/tech/tutorial-2-chat) we’ll create an application that can receive transactions in addition to sending them. Before we get to that, there’s something important you may have realized: the Saito AppStore is an application like any other application. Although our tutorial series starts with small applications, there’s no limit to the complexity of the applications that you want to build.

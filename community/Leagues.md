# Saito Community Game Nights

The Saito Arcade is a place for new and experienced gamers to hang out, play new games, and participate in periodic tournaments. Different community-led activities happen at different times. Consider dropping by for:

## Twilight Struggle - Mondays

Twilight Struggle is one of the best boardgames ever created, and the Saito Arcade is frankly a bit of a TS-snakepit. The community has a number of really excellent players, and we tend to congregate for open games on Monday evenings (Asia-time).

## Red Imperium - Tuesdays

Red Imperium is one of the more complicated games on the Saito Arcade. Games support up to 6 players and usually take 3-4 hours to complete. We host public games on Tuesday evening. They are fun. If you have the time for a game, feel welcome to drop by and join us.

## Here I Stand - Wednesdays

Here I Stand is another fantastic game from GMT Games. Several of us have licenses to host games, and we usually congregate for a public game on Wednesday evening (newbies welcome). If you're a new playing looking to learn or trying to figure out if the game is worth the price (hint: yes), this is a great time to drop by and get your feet wet.

## Saito Poker League - Thursdays

The Saito Poker League runs open tables on Thursday evenings. Up to six players can come and join our table, although there's really no limit on the amount of tables that we can run at one time. If you show up and a table is full just create a new table.

## EGLD Gaming Nights - Fridays

Saito has received a lot of support from the EGLD community, and are trying to contribute back by running a dedicated EGLD Gaming Night. This event takes place every Friday, and gives EGLD members an opportunity to play each other in EGLD-staked games on the Saito Arcade. If you're a member of the EGLD community looking for poker nights or just some laid-back EGLD-friendly gaming, you are welcome to drop by.
